	"Which bare him Zamran, and Jecsan, and Madan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue.\n"
	"Jecsan also begat Saba & Dadan. The Children of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim, and Loomim.\n"
	"But also of Madian was born Epha, and Opher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa: all these were the children of Cetura.\n"
	"And Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac:\n"
	"and to the children of his concubines he gave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his son, whilst himself yet lived, to the east country.\n"
	"And the days of Abraham's life were an hundred seventy and five years.\n"
	"And decaying died in a good old age, and having lived a great time, and being full of days and was gathered to his people.\n"
	"And there buried him Isaac and Ismael his sons in the double cave, which was situated in the field of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over-against Mambre,\n"
	"which he had bought of the children of Heth: there was he buried, and Sara his wife.\n"
	"And after his death God blessed Isaac his son, who dwelled beside the well of the Living & Seeing, so named.\n"
	"These are the generations of Ismael the son of Abraham, whom Agar the Aegyptian bare him, Sara's servant: &\n"
	"These are the names of his children according to their calling and generations. The first begotten of Ishmael Nabajoth, then Cedar, and Adbeel, and Mabsam,\n"
	"Masma also, and Duma, and Massa,\n"
	"Hadar, and Thema, and Iethur, and Naphis, and Cedma.\n"
	"These are the sons of Ismael: and these are their names by their castles and towns, twelve Princes of their tribes.\n"
	"And the years of Ismael's life came to an hundred thirty seven, and decaying died, and was put unto his people.\n"
	"And he dwelt from Hevila even to Sur, which looketh towards Aegypt, as they enter to the Assyrians, before the face of all his brethren died he.\n"
	"These also are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham: Abraham begat Isaac:\n"
	"Who when he was forty years old, took to wife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian of Mesopotamia, sister to Laban.\n"
	"And Isaac besought our Lord for his wife, because she was barren: who heard him, and made Rebecca to conceive.\n"
	"But the little ones struggled in her womb; who said: If it should be so with me, what need was there to conceive? And she went to consult our Lord.\n"
	"Who answering said: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb, and one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.\n"
	"Now her time was come to be delivered, and behold twins were found in her womb.\n"
	"He that came forth first, was red, and all hairy in manner of a skin: and his name was called Esau. Immediately the other coming forth, held his brother's plant in his hand: and therefore he called him Jacob.\n"
	"Threescore years old was Isaac, when the little ones were born unto him.\n"
	"Who being grown up, Esau became a man cunning in hunting, & a husband man: but Jacob a plain man dwelled in tents:\n"
	"Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his hunting: and Rebecca loved Jacob.\n"
	"& Jacob boiled broth: to whom Esau being come faint out of the field,\n"
	"said: Give me of this red broth, because I am exceeding faint. For which cause his name was called Edom.\n"
	"To whom Jacob said: sell me thy first-birth-right.\n"
	"He answered, Lo I die, what will the first-birth-right avail me?\n"
	"Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau sware to him, and sold his first-birth-right.\n"
	"And so taking bread and the rice broth, did eat, and drink, and went his way; little esteeming that he had sold his first-birth-right.";

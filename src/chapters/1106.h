const char* chap1106 = "AND again he began to teach at the sea side; and a great multitude was gathered together unto him so that he went up into a boat, and sat in the sea, and all the multitude about the sea was upon the land.\n"
	"And he taught them in parables many things, and said to them in his doctrine:\n"
	"Hear ye; Behold, the sower went forth to sow.\n"
	"And whiles he soweth, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came, and did eat it.\n"
	"And othersome fell upon rocky places where it had not much earth: and it shot up immediately, because it had not deepness of earth:\n"
	"and when the sun was risen, it parched, and because it had not root, it withered.\n"
	"And some fell among thorns: and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded not fruit.\n"
	"And some fell upon good ground; and it yielded fruit that grew up & increased, and it brought forth, one thirty, one sixty, and one an hundred.\n"
	"And he said: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n"
	"And when he was alone, the Twelve that were with him, asked him the parable.\n"
	"And he said to them: To you it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God; but to them that are without, all things are done in parables:\n"
	"that seeing they may see, and not see; and hearing they may hear, and not understand: lest at any time they should be converted and their sins be forgiven them.\n"
	"And he saith to them: Do you not know this parable? And how shall you know all parables?\n"
	"He that soweth, soweth the word.\n"
	"And they by the way side, are these: where the word is sown, and when they shall have heard, immediately cometh Satan, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.\n"
	"And they likewise that are sown upon the rocky places, are these: who when they hear the word, immediately with joy receive it;\n"
	"And they have not root in themselves, but are temporal: afterward when tribulation is risen and persecution for the word, forthwith they are scandalized.\n"
	"And other there be that are sown among thorns: these are they that hear the word,\n"
	"and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches, and concupiscences about other things entering in^ choke the word, and it is made fruitless.\n"
	"And these are they that were sown upon the good ground, which hear the word, and receive it, and yield fruit one thirty, one sixty, and one an hundred.\n"
	"And he said to them: Cometh a candle to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? And not to be put upon the candlestick?\n"
	"For there is nothing hid, which shall not be made manifest: neither was any thing made secret, but that it shall come to light.\n"
	"If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.\n"
	"And he said to them: See what you hear. In what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again, and more shall be given to you.\n"
	"For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, that also which he hath, shall be taken away from him.\n"
	"And he said: So is the Kingdom of God, as if a man cast seed into the earth,\n"
	"and sleep, and rise up night and day, and the seed spring, and grow up whiles he knoweth not.\n"
	"For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, afterward the full corn in the ear.\n"
	"And when the fruit hath brought out itself, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because harvest is come.\n"
	"And he said: To what shall we liken the Kingdom of God? or to what parable shall we compare it?\n"
	"As a mustard seed; which when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth:\n"
	"And when it is sown, it riseth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and maketh great boughs, so that the birds of the air may dwell under the shadow thereof.\n"
	"And with many such parables he spake to them the word, according as they were able to hear:\n"
	"and without parable he did not speak unto them; but apart, he explicated all things to his Disciples.\n"
	"And he saith to them in that day, when evening was come: Let us pass over to the other side.\n"
	"And dismissing the multitude, they take him so as he was in the boat: and there were other boats with him.\n"
	"And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was filled.\n"
	"And he was in the hinder part of the boat, sleeping upon a pillow; and they raise him, and say to him: Master, doth it not pertain to thee that we perish?\n"
	"And rising up he threatened the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased; and there was made a great calm.\n"
	"And he said to them: Why are you fearful? Neither yet have you faith? And they feared with great fear: and they said one to another, who is this (thinkest thou) that both wind and sea obey him?";

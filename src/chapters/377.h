	"Which when Jeroboam the son of Nabat heard, who was in Aegypt (for he was fled thither from Salomon) forthwith he returned.\n"
	"And they called him, and he came with all Israel & spake to Roboam, saying:\n"
	"Thy father pressed us with a most hard yoke, do thou command lighter things than thy father, who laid upon us a heavy servitude, and ease thou a little of the burden, that we may serve thee.\n"
	"Who said: After three days return ye to me. And when the people was gone,\n"
	"he took counsel with the Ancients, which stood before his father Salomon, whiles he yet lived, saying: What counsel give you, that I may answer the people?\n"
	"Who said to him: If thou wilt please this people, and pacify them with words of clemency, they will serve thee at all times.\n"
	"But he forsook the counsel of the Ancients, and began to treat with young men, that had been brought up with him, and were in his train.\n"
	"And he said to them: What seemeth to you? Or what shall I answer this people, which hath said to me: Ease the yoke which my father laid upon us?\n"
	"But they answered as youngmen, & brought up with him in delicateness, and said: Thus shalt thou speak to the people, that said to thee: Thy father aggravated our yoke, do thou ease it: and thus shalt thou answer them: My least finger is thicker than the loins of my father.\n"
	"My father laid upon you an heavy yoke, and I will add a greater weight: my father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you with scorpions.\n"
	"Jeroboam therefore came, and all the people to Roboam the third day, as he had commanded them.\n"
	"And the king answered rough words, leaving the counsel of the Ancients:\n"
	"And he spake according to the youngmen's will: My father laid upon you a heavy yoke, which I will make heavier: my father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you with scorpions.\n"
	"And he condescended not to the people's requests: for it was the will of God, that his word should be accomplished, which he had spoken by the hand of Ahias the Silonite to Jeroboam the son of Nabat.\n"
	"And all the people when the king spake rough words, said thus unto him: We have no part in David, nor inheritance in the son of Isai. Return into thy tabernacles o Israel, and do thou feed thy house David. And Israel went into their tabernacles.\n"
	"But over the children of Israel, that dwelt in the cities of Juda Roboam reigned.\n"
	"And king Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tributes, and the children of Israel stoned him, and he died: moreover king Roboam made haste to get up into his chariot, and fled into Jerusalem.\n"
	"And Israel revolted from the house of David until this day.";

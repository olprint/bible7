	"and the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, these commend to faithful men, which shall be fit to teach others also.\n"
	"Labour thou as a good soldier of Christ JESUS.\n"
	"No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses; that he may please him to whom he hath approved himself.\n"

	"Be mindful that our Lord JESUS Christ is risen again from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Gospel,\n"
	"wherein I labour even unto bands, as a malefactor: but the word of God is not tied.\n"
	"Therefore I sustain all things for the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation, which is in Christ JESUS, with heavenly glory.\n"
	"A faithful saying. For if we be dead with him, we shall live also together.\n"

	"But youthful desires^ fly, and pursue justice, faith, charity, and peace with them that invocate our Lord from a pure heart.\n"
	"And foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they engender brawls.\n"
	"But the servant of our Lord must not wrangle: but be mild toward all men, apt to teach, patient,\n"
	"with modesty admonishing them that resist the truth: lest sometime God give them repentance to know the truth:\n"

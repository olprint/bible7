const char* chap224 = "And again the children of Israel did evil in the sight of our Lord: who delivered them into the hands of the Philistiims forty years.\n"
	"And there was a certain man of Saraa, and of the stock of Dan, named Manue, having a wife barren.\n"
	"To whom an Angel of our Lord appeared, and said to her: Thou art barren and without children: but thou shalt conceive & bear a son:\n"
	"beware therefore that thou drink not wine & sicer, nor eat any unclean thing:\n"
	"because thou shalt conceive & bear a son, whose head the razor shall not touch: for he shall be a Nazarite of God, from his infancy, and from his mother's womb, and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistiims.\n"
	"Who when she was come to her husband, said to him: A man of God came to me, having an Angelical countenance, exceeding terrible. Whom when I had asked, who he was, and whence he came, and by what name he was called, he would not tell me:\n"
	"but this he answered: Behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son: beware thou drink not wine nor sicer, and that thou eat not any unclean thing: for the child shall be the Nazarite of God from his infancy, and from his mother's womb until the day of his death.\n"
	"Manue therefore prayed to our Lord, and said: I beseech thee, o Lord, that the man of God, whom thou didst send, may come again, and teach us what we ought to do concerning the child that shall be born.\n"
	"And our Lord heard Manue praying, and the Angel of our Lord appeared again to his wife sitting in the field, but Manue her husband was not with her. Who when she had seen the Angel,\n"
	"hastened, and ran to her husband: and she told him, saying: Behold the man hath appeared to me, whom I saw before.\n"
	"Who rose, and followed his wife: and coming to the man, said to him: Art thou he that didst speak to the woman? And he answered: I am.\n"
	"To whom Manue, when, said he, thy word shall be fulfilled, what wilt thou that the child do? Or from what shall he keep himself?\n"
	"And the Angel of our Lord said to Manue: From all things, which I have spoken to thy wife, let him refrain himself:\n"
	"and whatsoever groweth of the vineyard, let him not eat: wine and sicer let him not drink, let him not eat any unclean thing: and whatsoever I have commanded her, let him fulfill and keep.\n"
	"And Manue said to the Angel of our Lord: I beseech thee that thou condescend to my petitions, and let us make to thee a kid of goats.\n"
	"to whom the Angel answered: If thou constrain me, I will not eat thy bread: but if thou wilt make holocaust, offer it to our Lord. And Manue knew not that it was an Angel of our Lord.\n"
	"And he said to him: What is thy name, that, if thy word shall be fulfilled, we may honour thee?\n"
	"To whom he answered: Why asketh thou my name, which is marvelous?\n"
	"Manue therefore took a kid of the goats: and the libaments, & put them upon a rock, offering to our Lord, who doth marvelous things: & he and his wife looked on.\n"
	"And when the flame of the altar ascended into heaven, the Angel of our Lord ascended together in the flame. Which when Manue and his wife had seen, they fell flat on the ground,\n"
	"& the Angel of our Lord appeared to them no more. And forthwith Manue understood that it was an Angel of our Lord,\n"
	"and he said to his wife: Dying we shall die, because we have seen God.\n"
	"To whom his wife answered: If our Lord would have killed us, he would not have taken of our hands holocausts and libaments, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor have told us these things that are to come.\n"
	"She therefore bare a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and our Lord blessed him.\n"
	"And the Spirit of our Lord began to be with him in the camp of Dan betwixt Saraa and Esthaol.";

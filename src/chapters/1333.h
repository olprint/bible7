	"And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying: Behold the tabernacle of God with men, and he will dwell with them. And they shall be his people: and he God with them shall be their God.\n"
	"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and death shall be no more, nor mourning, nor crying, neither shall there be sorrow any more, which first things, are gone.\n"

	"And he said to me: It is done, I am Alpha and Omega: the beginning and the end. To him that thirsteth I will give of the fountain of the water of life, gratis.\n"

	"And he took me up in spirit unto a mountain great and high: and he shewed me the holy city Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God,\n"
	"having the glory of God, and the light thereof like to a precious stone, as it were to the jasper stone, even as crystal.\n"

	"On the East, three gates: and on the North, three gates: and on the South, three gates: and on the West, three gates.\n"

	"And the city is situated quadrangle-wise, and the length thereof is as great as also the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed for twelve thousand furlongs, & the length and height and breadth thereof be equal.\n"
	"And he measured the wall thereof of an hundred forty four cubits, the measure of a man which is of an Angel.\n"
	"And the building of the wall thereof was of jasper stone: but the city it-self pure gold, like to pure glass.\n"
	"And the foundations of the wall of the city, were adorned with all precious stone. The first foundation, the jasper: the second, the sapphire: the third, the calcedonius: the fourth, the emerald:\n"

	"And the Gentiles shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honour into it.\n"
	"And the gates thereof shall not be shut by day: for there shall be no night there.\n"
	"And they shall bring the glory and honour of nations into it.\n"
	"There shall not enter into it any polluted thing, nor that doeth abomination and maketh lie, but they that are written in the book of life of the Lamb.";

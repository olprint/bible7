const char* chap1264 = "FOR the rest, brethren, pray for us, that the word of God may have course and be glorified, as also with you:\n"
	"and that we may be delivered from importunate and naughty men. For all men have not faith.\n"
	"But our Lord is faithful, who will confirm and keep you from evil.\n"
	"And we have confidence of you in our Lord, that the things which we command, both you do, and will do.\n"
	"And our Lord direct your hearts in the charity of God, and patience of Christ.\n"
	"And we denounce unto you, brethren, in the name of our Lord JESUS Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother walking inordinately, and not according to the tradition which they have received of us.\n"
	"For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us: for we have not been unquiet among you:\n"
	"neither have we eaten bread of any man gratis, but in labour & in toil night and day working, lest we should burden any of you.\n"
	"Not as though we had not authority: but that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you for to imitate us.\n"
	"For also when we were with you, this we denounced to you, that if any will not work, neither let him eat.\n"
	"For we have heard of certain among you that walk unquietly, working nothing, but curiously meddling.\n"
	"And to them that be such we denounce, & beseech them in our Lord JESUS Christ, that working with silence, they eat their own bread.\n"
	"But you, brethren faint not well-doing.\n"
	"And if any obey not our word, note him by an epistle:\n"
	"and do not company with him, that he may be confounded: and do not esteem him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.\n"
	"And the Lord of peace himself give you everlasting peace in every place. Our Lord be with you all.\n"
	"The salutation, with mine own hand, Paul's: which is a sign in every epistle. So I write.\n"
	"The grace of our Lord JESUS Christ be with you all. Amen.";

const char* chap1088 = "AT that time Herod the Tetrarch heard the fame of JESUS:\n"
	"and said to his servants: This is John the Baptist: he is risen from the dead, & therefore virtues work in him.\n"
	"For Herod apprehended John and bound him, & put him into prison because of Herodias, his brother's wife.\n"
	"For John said unto him: It is not lawful for thee to have her.\n"
	"And willing to put him to death, he feared the People: because they esteemed him as a Prophet.\n"
	"But on Herod's birth-day, the daughter of Herodias danced before them: and pleased Herod.\n"
	"Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatsoever she would ask of him.\n"
	"But she being instructed before of her mother saith: Give me here in a dish the head of John the Baptist.\n"
	"And the king was stroken sad: yet because of his oath, and for them that sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given.\n"
	"And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.\n"
	"And his head was brought in a dish: and it was given to the damsel, and she brought it to her mother.\n"
	"And his Disciples came and took the body, and buried it: and came and told JESUS.\n"
	"Which when JESUS had heard, he retired from thence by boat, into a desert place apart, and the multitudes having heard of it, followed him on foot out of the cities.\n"
	"And he coming forth saw a great multitude, and pitied them, and cured their diseased.\n"
	"And when it was evening, his Disciples came unto him, saying: It is a desert place, and the hour is now past: dismiss the multitudes, that going into the towns, they may buy themselves victuals.\n"
	"But JESUS said to them: They have no need to go: give ye them to eat.\n"
	"They answered him: We have not here, but five loaves, and two fishes.\n"
	"Who said to them: Bring them hither to me.\n"
	"And when he had commanded the multitude to sit down upon the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up unto Heaven he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his Disciples, and the Disciples to the multitudes.\n"
	"And they did all eat, and had their fill. And they took the leavings, twelve full baskets of the fragments.\n"
	"And the number of them that did eat was, five thousand men, beside women and children.\n"
	"And forthwith JESUS commanded his Disciples to go up into the boat, and to go before him over the water, till he dismissed the multitudes.\n"
	"And having dismissed the multitude, he ascended into a mountain alone to pray. And when it was evening, he was there alone.\n"
	"But the boat in the midst of the sea was tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.\n"
	"And in the fourth watch of the night, he came unto them walking upon the sea.\n"
	"And seeing him upon the sea walking, they were troubled saying: That it is a ghost: & for fear they cried out.\n"
	"And immediately JESUS spake unto them, saying: Have confidence: it is I, fear ye not.\n"
	"And Peter making answer said: Lord if it be thou, bid me come to thee upon the waters.\n"
	"And he said, Come. And Peter descending out of the boat, walked upon the water to come to JESUS.\n"
	"But seeing the wind rough, he was afraid: and when he began to be drowned, he cried out saying: Lord, save me.\n"
	"And incontinent JESUS stretching forth his hand took hold of him, and said unto him: O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?\n"
	"And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased.\n"
	"And they that were in the boat, came and adored him, saying: Indeed thou art the Son of God.\n"
	"And having passed the water, they came into the country of Genesar.\n"
	"And when the men of that place understood of him, they sent into all that country, and brought unto him all that were ill at ease:\n"
	"and they besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment, and whosoever did touch, were made whole.";

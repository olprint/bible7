const char* chap19 = "And the two Angels came to Sodome at even, and Lot sitting in the gates of the city. Who when he had seen them, rose up & went to meet them: and adored prostrate unto the ground,\n"
	"and said: I beseech you, my Lords, turn into the house of your servant, and lodge there: Wash your feet, and in the morning you shall go forth on your way. Who said: No, but we will abide in the street.\n"
	"He compelled them earnestly to turn in unto him: and when they were entered into his house, he made them a banquet, and baked unleavened bread, and they did eat.\n"
	"And before they went to bed, the men of the city beset the house from young to old, all the people together.\n"
	"And they called Lot, and said to him: Where are the men that came in to thee at night? Bring them forth hither that we may know them.\n"
	"Lot going forth to them, and shutting the door after him, said:\n"
	"Do not so, I beseech you, my brethren, do not commit this evil.\n"
	"I have two daughters, which as yet have not known man: I will bring them forth to you, and abuse you them as it shall please you, so that you do no evil to these men, because they are entered under the shadow of my roof.\n"
	"But they said: Get thee back thither. And again: Thou camest in, said they, as a stranger, what to be a Judge? Thyself therefore we will afflict more than these. And they did violence to Lot exceedingly: and it was even now at the point that they would break the doors.\n"
	"And behold the men put forth their hand, and drew in Lot unto them, and shut the door:\n"
	"and them that were without they struck with blindness from the least to the greatest, so that they could not find the door.\n"
	"And they said to Lot: Hast thou here any of thine? Son in law, or sons, or daughters, all that are thine, bring them out of this city:\n"
	"for we will destroy this place, for that their cry is waxen loud before our Lord, who hath sent us to destroy them.\n"
	"Therefore Lot went forth, and spake to his sons in law that were to take his daughters, and said: Arise, get you forth out of this place, because our Lord will destroy this city. And he seemed unto them to speak as it were in jest.\n"
	"And when it was morning, the Angels urged him, saying: Arise, take thy wife, and the two daughters which thou hast: lest thou also perish withal in the wickedness of the city.\n"
	"He lingering, they took his hand, and the hand of his wife, and of his two daughters, because our Lord spared him.\n"
	"And they led him forth, and set him without the city; and there they spake to him, saying: Save thy life; look not back, neither stay thou in all the country about: but save thyself in the mountain, lest thou also perish withal.\n"
	"And Lot said to them: I beseech thee my Lord,\n"
	"because thy servant hath found grace before thee, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast wrought with me, in that thou wouldest save my life, and safe I cannot be in the mountain, lest perhaps the evil catch me, and I die.\n"
	"There is this city here-by at hand, whereunto I may fly, a little one, and I shall be safe in it: is it not a little one, and my life shall be saved?\n"
	"And he said to him: Behold also in this point I have heard thy prayers, not to overthrow the city for which thou hast spoken.\n"
	"Make haste, and be saved there: because I cannot do any thing till thou enter in thither. Therefore the name of that city was called Segor.\n"
	"The sun was risen upon the earth, and Lot entered into Segor.\n"
	"Therefore our Lord rained upon Sodome and Gomorre brimstone & fire from our Lord out of heaven:\n"
	"and he subverted these cities, and all the country about, all the inhabitants of the cities, and all things that spring of the earth.\n"
	"And his wife looking behind her, was turned into a statua of salt.\n"
	"And Abraham getting up early in the morning, there where before he had stood with our Lord,\n"
	"beheld Sodome and Gomorre, and the whole land of that country: and he saw the cinders rise up from the earth as it were the smoke of a furnace.\n"
	"For when God subverted the cities of that country, he remembering Abraham, delivered Lot out of the subversion of the cities wherein he had dwelt.\n"
	"And Lot ascended out of Segor, and abode in the mountain, his two daughters also with him (for he was afraid to abide in Segor) and he abode in a cave himself, and his two daughters with him.\n"
	"And the elder said to the younger: Our father is old, and there is no man left on the earth, that may company with us after the manner of the whole earth.\n"
	"Come, let us make him drunk with wine, and let us lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n"
	"They therefore made their father to drink wine that night: and the elder went in, and lay with her father: but he perceived not, neither when his daughter lay down, nor when she rose up.\n"
	"The next day also the elder said to the younger: Behold I lay yesternight with my father, let us make him drink wine also this night, and thou shalt lie with him, that we may save seed of our father.\n"
	"They made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in, and lay with him: and neither then truly did he perceive when she lay down, or when she rose up.\n"
	"The two daughters therefore of Lot were with child by their father.\n"
	"And the elder bare a son and she called his name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites even to this present day.\n"
	"The younger also bare a son, and she called his name Ammon, that is the son of my people: he is the father of the Ammonites even to this day.";

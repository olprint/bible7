const char* chap58 = "Our Lord also said to Moyses: Go in to Pharao, and thou shalt say unto him: This saith the Lord: Dismiss my people for to sacrifice unto me.\n"
	"but if thou wilt not dismiss them, behold I will strike all thy coasts with frogs.\n"
	"And the river shall bubble with frogs, which shall come up, and enter into thy house, and thy bed-chamber, and upon thy bed, and into the houses of thy servants, and unto thy people, and into thy ovens, and into the remains of thy meats:\n"
	"and unto thee, and to thy people, and to all thy servants shall the frogs enter.\n"
	"And our Lord said to Moyses: Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand upon the floods, and upon the rivers and the pools, and bring forth frogs upon the Land of Aegypt.\n"
	"And Aaron stretched forth his hand upon the waters of Aegypt, and the frogs came up, and covered the Land of Aegypt.\n"
	"And the enchanters also by their enchantments did in like manner, and they brought forth frogs upon the Land of Aegypt.\n"
	"And Pharao called Moyses and Aaron, and said to them: Pray ye to the Lord to take away the frogs from me & from my people and I will dismiss the people to sacrifice unto the Lord.\n"
	"And Moyses said to Pharao: Appoint me when I shall pray for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs may be driven away from thee and from thy house, and from thy servants, and from thy people, and may remain only in the river.\n"
	"Who answered: Tomorrow. But he said: According to thy word will I do; that thou mayst know that there is not the like to the Lord our God.\n"
	"And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy house, and from thy servants, and from thy people: and shall remain only in the river.\n"
	"And Moyses and Aaron went forth from Pharao: and Moyses cried to our Lord for the promise, concerning the frogs, which he had agreed to Pharao.\n"
	"And our Lord did according to the word of Moyses: and the frogs died out of the houses, and out of the villages, and out of the fields:\n"
	"and they gathered them together into huge heaps, and the earth did rot.\n"
	"And Pharao seeing that rest was given he hardened his own heart; and heard them not, as our Lord had commanded.\n"
	"And our Lord said to Moyses: Speak to Aaron: Stretch forth thy rod, and strike the dust of the earth: and be there sciniphs in the whole Land of Aegypt.\n"
	"And they did so. And Aaron stretched forth his hand, holding the rod: and he struck the dust of the earth, and there were made sciniphs on men and on beasts: all the dust of the earth was turned into sciniphs through the whole Land of Aegypt.\n"
	"And the enchanters with their enchantments practised in like manner to bring forth sciniphs, and they could not: and there were sciniphs as well on men as on beasts.\n"
	"And the enchanters said to Pharao: This is the finger of God. And Pharao's heart was indurate, and he heard them not as our Lord had commanded.\n"
	"Our Lord also said to Moyses: Arise early, and stand before Pharao: for he will go forth to the waters: & thou shalt say to him: This saith our Lord: Dismiss my people to sacrifice unto me.\n"
	"And if thou wilt not dismiss them, behold I will send in upon thee & upon thy servants, & upon thy people, and upon thy houses all kind of flies: and the houses of Aegypt shall be filled with flies of diverse kinds, and the whole land wherein they shall be.\n"
	"And I will make the Land of Gessen marvelous in that day, wherein my people is, so that flies shall not be there: & thou shalt know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.\n"
	"And I will put a division between my people & thy people: tomorrow shall this sign be.\n"
	"And our Lord did so. And there came a very grievous fly into the houses of Pharao & of his servants, & into all the Land of Aegypt: & the Land was corrupted by such kind of flies.\n"
	"And Pharao called Moyses & Aaron, and said to them. Go and sacrifice to your God in this land.\n"
	"And Moyses said: It cannot so be done: for if we shall offer the abominations of the Aegyptians to the Lord our God, and we kill those things which the Aegyptians do worship before them, they will beat us down with stones.\n"
	"We will go forth three days' journey into the wilderness: and we will sacrifice unto the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.\n"
	"And Pharao said: I will dismiss you to sacrifice to the Lord your God in the desert: but go no farther: pray for me.\n"
	"And Moyses said: Being gone forth from thee, I will pray to our Lord: and the fly shall depart from Pharao, and from his servants, and from his people tomorrow: but deceive no more so, that thou wilt not dismiss the people to sacrifice unto our Lord.\n"
	"And Moyses being gone forth from Pharao, prayed our Lord.\n"
	"Who did according to his word: and he took away the flies from Pharao, and from his servants, and from his people: there was left not so much as one.\n"
	"And Pharao's heart was hardened, so that neither this time would he dismiss the people.";

	"Out of Sion the beauty of his comeliness.\n"
	"God will come manifestly: our God and he will not keep silence. Fire shall burn forth in his sight: and round about him a mighty tempest.\n"
	"He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth to discern his people.\n"
	"Gather ye together his Saints unto him: which ordain his testament above sacrifices.\n"
	"And the heavens shall shew forth his justice: because God is Judge.\n"
	"Hear, o my people, and I will speak: Israel, and I will testify to thee: God thy God am I.\n"
	"I will not rebuke thee in thy sacrifices: and thy holocausts are in my sight always.\n"
	"I will not take calves out of thy house: nor buck-goats out of thy flocks.\n"
	"Because all the wild beasts of the woods be mine, the cattle in the mountains and oxen.\n"
	"I have known all the fowls of the air: and the beauty of the field is with me.\n"
	"If I shall be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the round earth is mine, and the fullness thereof.\n"

	"Immolate to God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows to the Highest.\n"
	"And invocate me in the day of tribulation: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.\n"
	"But to the sinner God hath said: Why doest thou declare my justices, and takest my testament by thy mouth?\n"
	"But thou hast hated discipline & cast my words behind thee.\n"
	"If thou didst see a thief, thou didst run with him: and with adulterers thou didst put thy portion.\n"
	"Thy mouth hath abounded with malice: and thy tongue forged guiles.\n"
	"Sitting thou spakest against thy brother, and against thy mother's son thou didst put a scandal:\n"
	"these things hast thou done, and I have held my peace. Thou hast thought unjustly that I will be like thee: I will reprove thee, and set it against thy face.\n"
	"Understand these things you that forget God: lest sometime he take you violently and there be none to deliver you.\n"
	"The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me: and there is the way, by which I will shew him the salvation of God.";

	"He sent also to Hiram the king of Tyre, saying: As thou didst with David my father, and didst send him cedar-trees, to build him a house, wherein also he dwelt:\n"
	"so do with me that I may build a house to the name of our Lord my God, that I may consecrate it to burn incense before him, and to perfume with aromatical spices, and to the everlasting proposition of loaves, and for holocausts, morning and evening, on the sabbaths also, and the new moons, and the solemnities of our Lord God for ever, which are commanded Israel.\n"
	"For the house which I desire to build, is great: for our God is great above all gods.\n"
	"Who then can be able to build him a worthy house? If heaven, and the heavens of heavens cannot contain him: how great am I, that I may build him a house? But to this end only, that incense may be burnt before him.\n"
	"Send me therefore a cunning man, that hath skill to work in gold, and silver, brass, & iron, purple, scarlet, and hyacinth, and that knoweth to make engraved works with these artificers, which I have with me in Jewry, and Jerusalem, whom David my father prepared.\n"
	"But send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and pine trees from Libanus: for I know that thy servants have skill to hew the timber of Libanus, and my servants shall be with thy servants,\n"

	"And he added, saying: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, that made heaven & earth, who hath given to David the king a son wise and learned, and of understanding, and prudent, to build a house to the Lord, and a palace for himself.\n"

	"the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, whose father was a Tyrian, who knoweth to work in gold, and silver, brass, and iron, and marble, and in timber, in purple also, and in hyacinth, and silk, and scarlet: and that knoweth to grave all engraving, and to devise wisely whatsoever in the work is necessary with thy artificers, & with the artificers of my lord David thy father.\n"
	"The wheat therefore, & barley, & oil, and wine, which thou my lord hast promised, send to thy servants.\n"
	"And we will cut down the trees out of Libanus, as many as shall be necessary for thee, and will convey them in boats by the sea unto Joppe: and it shall be thy part to transport them into Jerusalem.\n"

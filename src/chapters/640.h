	"It is vain for you to rise before light: rise ye after ye have sitten, which eat the bread of sorrow.\n"
	"When he shall give sleep to his beloved: behold the inheritance of our Lord are children: the reward, the fruit of the womb.\n"
	"As arrows in the hand of the mighty: so are the children of them that are shaken.\n"
	"Blessed is the man that hath filled his desire of them: he shall not be confounded when he shall speak to his enemies in the gate.";

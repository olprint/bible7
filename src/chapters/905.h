	"Our Lord hath cast down headlong, and hath not spared, all the beautiful things of Jacob: he hath destroyed in his fury the munitions of the virgin of Juda, and cast it down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom, and the princes thereof.\n"
	"He hath broken every horn of Israel in the wrath of fury: he hath turned away his right hand backward from the face of the enemy: and he hath kindled in Jacob as it were the fire of a flame devouring round about.\n"
	"He hath bent his bow as an enemy, he hath fastened his right hand as an adversary: and he hast killed all, that was fair to behold in the tabernacle of the daughter of Sion, he hath poured out his indignation as fire.\n"

	"Our Lord hath rejected, he hath cursed his sanctification: he hath delivered the walls of the towers thereof into the hand of the enemy: they have made a noise in the house of our Lord, as in a solemn day.\n"

	"Mine eyes have failed for tears, my bowels are troubled: my liver is poured out on the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people, when the little one, and the sucking fainted in the streets of the town.\n"
	"They said to their mothers: Where is wheat and wine? When they fainted as the wounded in the streets of the city: when they yielded up the ghosts in the bosom of their mothers.\n"
	"Whereto shall I compare thee? Or whereto shall I liken thee o daughter of Jerusalem: whereto shall I make thee equal, and comfort thee o virgin daughter of Sion? For great is thy destruction as the sea: who shall heal thee?\n"
	"Thy prophets have seen false and foolish things for thee: neither have they opened thine iniquity, to provoke thee to penance, but they have seen false burdens and banishments for thee.\n"

	"The child and the old man lay on the ground without: my virgins and my youngmen are fallen by the sword: thou hast killed in the day of thy fury: thou hast strucken, neither hast thou had mercy.\n"
	"Thou hast called as it were to a solemn day, those that should terrify me round about, and there was none in the day of the fury of our Lord, that escaped and was left: whom I brought up, & nourished, mine enemy hath consumed them.";

	"If I should deliver myself to be thy servant I shall not deserve thy providence.\n"
	"Howbeit I beseech thee, that thou take unto thee beasts and servants, and go to Gabelus into Rages the city of Medes: and render him his hand writing, and receive of him the money, and desire him to come to my marriage.\n"
	"For thyself knowest that my father numbereth the days: and if I slack one day more, his soul is made sorrowful.\n"
	"And surely thou seest how Raguel hath adjured me, whose adjuring I cannot despise.\n"

	"And he told him of Tobias the son of Tobias, all things that were done: & made him come with him to the marriage.\n"
	"And when he was entered into Raguel's house, he found Tobias sitting at the table: and he leaping up, they kissed each other: and Gabelus wept, and blessed God,\n"
	"and said: The God of Israel bless thee, because thou art the son of a very good man, and just, and that feareth God, and doth alms deeds:\n"
	"and blessing be given upon thy wife, and upon your parents:\n"
	"and that you may see your children, and your children's children, unto the third and fourth generation: and your seed be blessed of the God of Israel, who reigneth for ever and ever.\n"
	"And when all had said, Amen, they went to the feast: but with the fear of our Lord also did they celebrate the feast of the marriage.";

	"And Hanani one of my brethren came, himself and men of Juda, and I asked them of the Jews, that remained, and were left alive of the captivity, and of Jerusalem.\n"
	"And they said to me: They that remained, and are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction, and in reproach: and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.\n"
	"And when I had heard these manner of words, I sat, and wept, and mourned many days: and fasted, and prayed before the face of the God of heaven.\n"
	"And I said: I beseech thee Lord God of heaven, strong, great, and terrible, which keepest covenant and mercy with them that love thee, and keep thy commandments:\n"
	"let thine ears be harkening, and thine eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee this day, night and day for the children of Israel thy servants: and I confess for the sins of the children of Israel, in which they have sinned to thee: I and my father's house have sinned,\n"
	"we have been seduced with vanity, & have not kept the commandments & ceremonies & judgment, which thou hast commanded to Moyses thy servant.\n"
	"Remember the word, that thou didst command unto Moyses thy servant, saying: When you shall transgress, I will disperse you into peoples:\n"
	"and if you return to me, and keep my precepts, and do them, although you shall be led away to the uttermost parts of heaven, thence will I gather you, and bring you back into the place, which I have chosen that my name should dwell there.\n"
	"And they are thy servants, and thy people: whom thou hast redeemed in thy great strength, and in thy mighty hand.\n"
	"I beseech thee Lord, let thine ear be attent to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, which will fear thy name: and direct thy servant this day, and give him mercy before this man. For I was the king's cup-bearer.";

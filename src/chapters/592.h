	"They have made the carcasses of thy servants, meats for the fowls of the air: the flesh of thy Saints for the beasts of the land.\n"
	"They have poured out their blood as water round about Jerusalem: and there was none to bury them.\n"
	"We are become a reproach to our neighbours: a scorn and mock to them that are round about us.\n"
	"How long, o Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever: shall thy zeal be kindled as a fire?\n"
	"Pour out thy wrath upon the Gentiles, that have not known thee: & upon the Kingdoms, that have not invocated thy name.\n"
	"Because they have devoured Jacob: and his place they have made desolate.\n"
	"Remember not our old iniquities, let thy mercies quickly prevent us: because we are become exceeding poor.\n"
	"Help us, o God our Saviour: and for the glory of thy name o Lord deliver us: and be propitious to our sins for thy name's sake.\n"
	"Lest they say perhaps amongst the Gentiles: where is their God? And be notified in the nations before our eyes. The revenge of the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed:\n"
	"let the groaning of the fettered enter in thy sight. According to the greatness of thine arm possess thou the children of them that are put to death.\n"
	"And render to our neighbours sevenfold in their bosom: their reproach wherewith they have reproached thee, o Lord.\n"
	"But we thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture, will confess to thee for ever. Unto generation and generation we will shew forth thy praise.";

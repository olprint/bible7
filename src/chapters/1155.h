const char* chap1155 = "AND before the festival day of Pasch, JESUS knowing that his hour was come that he should pass out of this world to his Father: whereas he had loved his that were in the world, unto the end he loved them.\n"
	"And when supper was done, whereas the devil now had put into the heart of Judas Iscariote the son of Simon, to betray him:\n"
	"knowing that the Father gave him all things into his hands, & that he came from God, and goeth to God:\n"
	"he riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and having taken a towel, girded himself.\n"
	"After that, he put water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of the Disciples, and to wipe them with the towel where with he was girded.\n"
	"He cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And Peter saith to him; Lord: doest thou wash my feet?\n"
	"JESUS answered and said to him: That which I do, thou knowest not now, hereafter thou shalt know.\n"
	"Peter saith to him: Thou shalt not wash my feet for ever. JESUS answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt not have part with me.\n"
	"Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also hands, and head.\n"
	"JESUS saith to him: He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.\n"
	"For he knew who he was that would betray him. therefore he said: You are not clean all.\n"
	"Therefore, after he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, being set down, again he said to them: Know you what I have done to you?\n"
	"You call me, Master, and Lord: and you say well, for I am so.\n"
	"If then I have washed your feet, Lord and Master; you also ought to wash one another's feet.\n"
	"For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also.\n"
	"Amen, amen I say to you, a servant is not greater than his Lord, neither is an Apostle greater than he that sent him.\n"
	"If you know these things, you shall be blessed if you do them.\n"
	"I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me shall lift up his heel against me.\n"
	"From this time I tell you, before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe, that I am he.\n"
	"Amen, amen, I say to you, he that receiveth any that I send, receiveth me: & he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.\n"
	"When JESUS had said these things, he was troubled in spirit: and he protested, and said: Amen, amen I say to you that one of you shall betray me.\n"
	"The Disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spake.\n"
	"There was therefore one of his Disciples leaning in the bosom of JESUS, he whom JESUS loved.\n"
	"Therefore Simon Peter beckoneth to him, and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh?\n"
	"He therefore leaning upon the breast of JESUS saith to him: Lord, who is he?\n"
	"JESUS answered: He it is to whom I shall reach the dipped bread. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariote Simon's son.\n"
	"And after the morsel, then Satan entered into him. And JESUS saith to him: That which thou doest, do it quickly.\n"
	"But no man knew of those that sat at table to what purpose he said this unto him.\n"
	"For certain thought, because Judas had the purse, that JESUS had said to him: Buy those things which are needful for us to the festival day: or that he should give some thing to the poor.\n"
	"He therefore having received the morsel, incontinent went forth. And it was night.\n"
	"When he therefore was gone forth, JESUS said: Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.\n"
	"If God be glorified in him, God also will glorify him in himself, and incontinent will he glorify him.\n"
	"Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me, & as I said to the Jews, whither I go, you cannot come: to you also I say now.\n"
	"A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.\n"
	"In this all men shall know that you are my Disciples, if you have love one to another.\n"
	"Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, whither goest thou? JESUS answered, Whither I go, thou canst not now follow me, but hereafter thou shalt follow.\n"
	"Peter saith to him: Why cannot I follow thee now? I will yield my life for thee.\n"
	"JESUS answered him: Thy life wilt thou yield for me? Amen, amen I say to thee, the cock shall not crow, until thou deny me thrice.";

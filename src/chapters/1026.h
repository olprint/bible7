const char* chap1026 = "In the eighth month in the second year of king Darius the word of our Lord was made to Zachary the son of Barachias, the son of Addo the Prophet, saying:\n"
	"Our Lord hath been wrath upon your fathers with wrath.\n"
	"And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Convert to me, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will convert to you, saith the Lord of hosts.\n"
	"Be not as your fathers, to whom the former Prophets cried, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Convert from your evil ways, and from your most wicked thoughts: and they heard not, neither attended to me, saith our Lord.\n"
	"Your fathers where are they? And the Prophets shall they live for ever?\n"
	"But yet my words, & mine ordinances, which I gave in commandment to my servants the Prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers, and they converted, and said: As the Lord of hosts thought to do to us according to our ways, & according to our inventions he hath done to us.\n"
	"In the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month Sabath: in the second year of Darius, the word of our Lord was made to Zacharie the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the Prophet, saying:\n"
	"I saw by night, and behold a man mounting upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees, that were in the bottom: and after him horses red, speckled, and white.\n"
	"And I said: What are these, my Lord? And the Angel that spake in me, said to me: I will shew thee what these things are.\n"
	"And the man, that stood among the myrtle-trees answered, and said: These are they, whom our Lord sent to walk through the earth.\n"
	"And they answered to the Angel of our Lord, which stood among the myrtle-trees, and said: We have walked through the earth, and lo all the earth is inhabited, & at rest.\n"
	"And the Angel of our Lord answered, and said: o Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem, & on the cities of Juda, with which thou hast been angry? This now is the seventieth year.\n"
	"And our Lord answered the Angel that spake in me, good words, comfortable words.\n"
	"And the Angel that spake in me, said to me: Cry, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I have been zealous for Jerusalem, and Sion with great zeal.\n"
	"And with great anger am I angry upon the wealthy nations: because I was angry a little, but they helped toward the evil.\n"
	"Therefore thus saith our Lord: I will return to Jerusalem in mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of hosts: & the plumb line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.\n"
	"As yet cry thou saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: As yet shall my cities flow with good things: and the Lord will yet comfort Sion, and he will yet choose Jerusalem.\n"
	"And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw: and behold four horns.\n"
	"And I said to the Angel that spake in me: What are these: And he said to me: These are the horns that have scattered Juda, and Israel, and Jerusalem.\n"
	"And our Lord shewed me four artificers.\n"
	"And I said: What come these to do? Who spake saying: These are the horns, that scattered Juda every man a-part, and none of them lifted his head: and these are come to fray them, to cast down the horns of the nations, that have lifted the horn upon the land of Juda to scatter it.";

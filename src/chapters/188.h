	"Moyses my servant is dead: arise, and pass over this Jordan thou and all the people with thee into the Land, which I will give to the children of Israel.\n"
	"Every place the step of your foot shall tread, will I deliver to you, as I have spoken to Moyses.\n"
	"From the desert and Libanus unto the great river Euphrates, all the land of the Hetheites unto the great sea against the going down of the sun, shall be your border.\n"
	"No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life: as I have been with Moyses, so will I be with thee: I will not leave nor forsake thee.\n"
	"Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt by lot divide to this people the Land, for the which I sware to their fathers, that I would deliver it to them.\n"
	"Take courage therefore, and be very strong: that thou keep and do all the Law, which Moyses my servant hath commanded thee: decline not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest understand all things which thou doest.\n"
	"Let not the volume of this law depart from thy mouth: but thou shalt meditate in it days and nights, that thou mayest keep and do all things that be written in it: then shalt thou direct thy way, and understand it.\n"
	"Behold I command thee, take courage, and be strong. Fear not, and dread not: because the Lord thy God is with thee in all the things to whatsoever thou shalt go.\n"
	"And Josue commanded the Princes of the people, saying: Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, and say:\n"
	"Prepare for yourselves victuals: for after the third day you shall pass over Jordan, and shall enter to possess the Land which our Lord your God will give you.\n"
	"To the Rubenites also & Gaddites, & half tribe of Manasses he said:\n"
	"Remember the word which Moyses the servant of our Lord commanded you, saying: Our Lord your God hath given you rest, and all this Land.\n"
	"Your wives, and children, and cattle shall tarry in the Land, which Moyses delivered to you beyond Jordan: but pass you over armed before your brethren, all that are strong of hand, and fight for them,\n"
	"until our Lord give rest to your brethren, as to you also he hath given, and they also possess the Land which our Lord your God will give them: and so return into the Land of your possession, & you shall dwell in it, which Moyses the servant of our Lord gave you beyond Jordan, against the rising of the sun.\n"
	"And they made answer to Josue, & said: all things that thou hast commanded us we will do: and whither soever thou shalt send us, we will go.\n"
	"As we obeyed Moyses in all things, so will we obey thee also: only be our Lord thy God with thee, as he was with Moyses.\n"
	"He that shall gainsay thy mouth, and not obey all thy words that thou shalt command him, let him die. Thou only take courage, and do manfully.";

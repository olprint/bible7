const char* chap1123 = "AND it came to pass, when the multitudes pressed upon him to hear the word of God, and himself stood beside the lake of Genesareth.\n"
	"And he saw two ships standing by the lake: and the fishers were gone down, and washed their nets.\n"
	"And he going up into one ship that was Simon's, desired him to bring it back a little from the land. And sitting, he taught the multitudes out of the ship.\n"
	"And as he ceased to speak, he said to Simon: Launch forth into the deep, and let loose your nets to make a draught.\n"
	"And Simon answering, said to him: Master, labouring all the night, we have taken nothing; but in thy word I will let loose the net.\n"
	"And when they had done this, they inclosed a very great multitude of fishes, and their net was broken.\n"
	"And they beckoned to their fellows that were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came and filled both ships, so that they did sink.\n"
	"Which when Simon Peter did see, he fell down at JESUS' knees, saying: Go forth from me, because I am a sinful man, O Lord.\n"
	"For he was wholly astonished and all that were with him, at the draught of fishes which they had taken.\n"
	"In like manner also James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's fellows. And JESUS said to Simon: Fear not; from this time now, thou shalt be taking men.\n"
	"And having brought their ships to land, leaving all things they followed him.\n"
	"And it came to pass, when he was in one of the cities, & behold a man full of leprosy, and seeing JESUS, and falling on his face, besought him saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.\n"
	"And stretching forth the hand, he touched him, saying: I will. Be thou made clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.\n"
	"And he commanded him that he should tell no body, but, Go, shew thyself to the Priest, and offer for thy cleansing as Moyses commanded, for a testimony to them.\n"
	"But the bruit of him went abroad the more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be cured of their infirmities.\n"
	"And he retired into the desert, and prayed.\n"
	"And it came to pass one day, and he sat teaching. And there were Pharisees sitting and Doctors of Law that were come out of every town of Galilee and Jewry and Jerusalem; and the virtue of our Lord was to heal them.\n"
	"And behold men carrying in a bed a man that had the palsy: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.\n"
	"And not finding on which side they might bring him in for the multitude, they went up upon the roof, and through the tiles let him down with the bed into the midst, before JESUS.\n"
	"Whose faith when he saw, he said: Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.\n"
	"And the Scribes and Pharisees began to think, saying: Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but only God?\n"
	"And when JESUS knew their cogitations, answering he said to them: What do you think in your hearts?\n"
	"Which is easier to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise, and walk?\n"
	"But that you may know that the Son of man hath power in earth to forgive sins (he said to the sick of the palsy) I say to thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.\n"
	"And forthwith rising up before them, he took that^ wherein he lay; and he went into his house, magnifying God.\n"
	"And all were astonished: and they magnified God. And they were replenished with fear, saying: That we have seen marvelous things today.\n"
	"And after these things he went forth, and saw a Publican called Levi, sitting at the Custom-house, and he said to him: Follow me.\n"
	"And leaving all things, he rose and followed him.\n"
	"And Levi made him a great feast in his house; and there was a great multitude of Publicans; and of others that were sitting at the table with them.\n"
	"And their Pharisees and Scribes murmured, saying to his disciples: Why do you eat and drink with Publicans and sinners?\n"
	"And JESUS answering said to them: They that are whole, need not the Physician: but they that are ill at ease.\n"
	"I came not to call the just, but sinners to penance.\n"
	"But they said to him: Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make obsecrations, and of the Pharisees in like manner; but thine do eat and drink?\n"
	"To whom he said: Why, can you make the children of the bridegroom fast whiles the bridegroom is with them?\n"
	"But the days will come; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then they shall fast in those days.\n"
	"And he said a similitude also unto them: That no man putteth a piece from a new garment into an old garment; otherwise both he breaketh the new, and the piece from the new agreeth not with the old.\n"
	"And no body putteth new wine into old bottles; otherwise the new wine will break the bottles, and itself will be shed, and the bottles will be lost.\n"
	"But new wine is to be put into new bottles: and both are preserved together.\n"
	"And no man drinking old, will new by and by, for he saith, The old is better.";

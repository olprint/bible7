const char* chap1145 = "AND there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a Prince of the Jews.\n"
	"This man came to JESUS by night, and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou art come from God a Master; for no man can do these signs which thou doest, unless God be with him.\n"
	"JESUS answered, and said to him: Amen, Amen I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.\n"
	"Nicodemus said to him: How can a man be born, when he is old? can he enter into his mother's womb again & be born?\n"
	"JESUS answered: Amen, Amen I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.\n"
	"That which is born of the flesh, is flesh: & that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.\n"
	"Marvel not, that I said to thee, You must be born again.\n"
	"The Spirit breatheth where he will; and thou hearest his voice, but thou knowest not whence he cometh and whither he goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.\n"
	"Nicodemus answered, & said to him: How can these things be done?\n"
	"JESUS answered, and said to him: Thou art a Master in Israel, and art thou ignorant of these things?\n"
	"Amen, Amen I say to thee, that we speak that which we know, and that which we have seen we testify, and our testimony you receive not.\n"
	"If I have spoken to you earthly things, and you believe not: how if I shall speak to you heavenly things, will you believe?\n"
	"And no man hath ascended into Heaven, but he that descended from Heaven, the Son of man which is in Heaven.\n"
	"And as Moyses exalted the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be exalted:\n"
	"that every one which believeth in him, perish not, but may have life everlasting.\n"
	"For so God loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son; that every one that believeth in him, perish not, but may have life everlasting.\n"
	"For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world, but that the world may be saved by him.\n"
	"He that believeth in him, is not judged. But he that doth not believe, is already judged: because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.\n"
	"And this is the judgement: because the light is come into the world, and men have loved the darkness rather than the light: for their works were evil.\n"
	"For every one that doeth ill, hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be controlled.\n"
	"But he that doeth verity, cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, because they were done in God.\n"
	"After these things JESUS came and his Disciples into the country of Jewry; & there he abode with them, and baptized.\n"
	"And John also was baptizing in Aenon beside Salim; because there was much water there, and they came, and were baptized.\n"
	"For John was not yet cast into prison.\n"
	"And there rose a question of John's Disciples with the Jews concerning purification.\n"
	"And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou didst give testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all come to him.\n"
	"John answered and said: A man cannot receive any thing, unless it be given him from Heaven,\n"
	"Yourselves do bear me witness, that I said, I am not CHRIST; but that I am sent before him.\n"
	"He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy for the voice of the bridegroom. This my joy therefore is filled.\n"
	"He must increase, and I diminish.\n"
	"He that cometh from above, is above all. He that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh. He that cometh from Heaven, is above all.\n"
	"And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: and his testimony no man receiveth.\n"
	"He that hath received his testimony, hath signed that God is true.\n"
	"For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God. For God doth not give the Spirit by measure.\n"
	"The Father loveth the Son: & he hath given all things in his hand.\n"
	"He that believeth in the Son: hath life everlasting: but he that is incredulous to the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God remaineth upon him.";

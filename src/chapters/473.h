const char* chap473 = "There was a man in the Land of Hus, named Job, and that man was simple, and right, and fearing God, and departing from evil.\n"
	"And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.\n"
	"And his possession was seven thousand sheep, & three thousand camels, also five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a family exceeding great: and that man was great among all them of the East.\n"
	"And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his day. And sending they called their three sisters to eat & drink with them.\n"
	"And when the days of feasting had passed about in course, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered holocausts for every one. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all the days.\n"
	"But on a certain day when the sons of God were come to assist before our Lord, Satan also was present among them.\n"
	"To whom our Lord said: From whence comest thou? Who answering, said: I have gone round about the earth, & walked through it.\n"
	"And our Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is not the like to him in the earth, a man simple, and right, and fearing God, and departing from evil?\n"
	"To whom Satan answering, said: Why, doth Job fear God in vain?\n"
	"hast not thou fenced him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?\n"
	"But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all things that he possesseth, unless he bless thee in the face.\n"
	"Our Lord therefore said to Satan: behold, all things that he hath, are in thy hand, only upon him extend not thy hand. And Satan went forth from the face of our Lord.\n"
	"And when upon a certain day his sons and daughters did eat, and drink wine in the house of their eldest brother,\n"
	"there came a messenger to Job, which said: The oxen ploughed, and the she-asses fed beside them,\n"
	"and the Sabeians came in violently, and have taken all things, and have strucken the servants with the sword, and I only have escaped to tell thee.\n"
	"And when he yet spake, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants hath consumed them, and I only have escaped to tell thee.\n"
	"But whilst he also was yet speaking, there came another and said: The Chaldees made three troops, and have invaded the camels, and taken them, moreover the servants also they have strucken with the sword, and I alone am fled to tell thee.\n"
	"He yet spake, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,\n"
	"suddenly a vehement wind came violently from the country of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, which falling oppressed thy children and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.\n"
	"Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, & with polled head falling on the ground, adored,\n"
	"and said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Our Lord gave, and our Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased our Lord, so is it done: the name of our Lord be blessed.\n"
	"In all these things Job sinned not with his lips, neither spake he any foolish thing against God.";

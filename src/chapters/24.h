const char* chap24 = "And Abraham was old, and of many days, and our Lord had blessed him in all things.\n"
	"And he said to the elder servant of his house, which was ruler over all that he had: Put thy hand under my thigh,\n"
	"that I may adjure thee by our Lord God of heaven and earth, that thou take not a wife for my son of the daughters of the Chananites, among whom I dwell:\n"
	"but that thou go unto mine own country and kindred, and thence take a wife for my son Isaac.\n"
	"The servant answered: If the woman will not come with me into this land, whether must I bring thy son back again to the place, from whence thou didst come forth?\n"
	"And Abraham said: Beware thou never bring my son back again thither.\n"
	"Our Lord God of heaven, which took me out of my father's house, and out of my native country, which spake to me, and sware to me, saying: To thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his Angel before thee, and thou shall take from thence a wife for my son:\n"
	"but if the woman will not follow thee, thou shalt not be bound by the oath: only bring not my son thither again.\n"
	"The servant therefore put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his lord, and sware to him upon this word.\n"
	"And he took ten camels of his lord's herd, and departed, of all his goods carrying something with him, and setting forward went on into Mesopotamia to the city of Nachor.\n"
	"And when he had made the camels lie down without the town beside a well of water at even, at the time when women are wont to come forth to draw water, he said:\n"
	"O Lord God of my lord Abraham, meet me today, I beseech thee, and do mercifully with my master Abraham.\n"
	"Behold I stand night to the fountain of water and the daughters of the inhabiters of this city will come forth to draw water.\n"
	"Therefore the maid, to whom I shall say: Bow down thy tankard that I may drink; and she shall answer: Drink, yea to thy camels also will I give drink; she it is, whom thou hast provided for thy servant Isaac: and by this I shall understand, that thou hast dealt mercifully with my master.\n"
	"Neither had he yet ended these words within himself, & behold Rebecca came forth, the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Melcha, wife to Nachor the brother of Abraham, having a tankard on her shoulder;\n"
	"a passing comely maid, & most beautiful virgin, & not known to man: and she was gone down to the fountain, and had filled her tankard, and came back.\n"
	"And the servant ran to meet her, and said: Give me a little water to drink of thy tankard.\n"
	"Who answered: Drink my lord. And quickly she let down the tankard upon her arm, and gave him drink.\n"
	"And when he had drunk, she added: but for thy camels also I will draw water, till all do drink.\n"
	"And pouring out the tankard into the troughs, she ran back to the well to draw water: and being drawn gave it to all the camels.\n"
	"But he musing beheld her with silence, desirous to know whether our Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.\n"
	"And after that the camels had drunk, the man plucked forth golden earlets, weighing two sicles, and as many bracelets of ten sicles weight.\n"
	"And he said to her: Whose daughter art thou? Shew me; is there any place in thy father's house to lodge?\n"
	"Who answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Melcha, whom she bare to Nachor.\n"
	"And she added, saying: Of straw also and hay we have good store, and a large place to lodge in.\n"
	"The man bowed himself, and adored our Lord,\n"
	"saying: blessed be the Lord God of my lord Abraham, that hath not taken away his mercy & truth from my lord, and hath brought me the straight way into the house of my lord's brother.\n"
	"The maid therefore ran, and reported into her mother's house all things that she had heard.\n"
	"And Rebecca had a brother named Laban, who in all haste went forth to the man, where the fountain was.\n"
	"And when he had seen the earlets and bracelets in his sister's hands, and hand heard all her words reporting: These words spake the man unto me; he came to the man which stood beside the camels, and nigh to the fountain of water:\n"
	"and said to him: Come in, thou blessed of our Lord: Why standest thou without? I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.\n"
	"And he brought him into his lodging: and he unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and hay, and water to wash his feet, and of the men that were come with him.\n"
	"And bread was set before him. Who said: I will not eat till I speak my message. He answered him: Speak.\n"
	"And he said: I am the servant of Abraham:\n"
	"And our Lord hath blessed my lord wonderfully, and he is magnified: and he hath given him sheep, & oxen, silver and gold, men servants & women servants, camels, and asses.\n"
	"And Sara my lord's wife hath born my lord a son in her old age, and he hath given him all things that he had.\n"
	"And my lord adjured me saying: Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the Chananites, in whose land I dwell:\n"
	"but thou shalt go to my father's house, and of mine own kindred shalt thou take a wife for my son:\n"
	"but I answered my lord: What if the woman will not come with me?\n"
	"Our Lord, saith he, in whose sight I walk, will send his Angel with thee, & will direct thy way: and thou shalt take a wife for my son of mine own kindred, and of my father's house.\n"
	"Thou shalt be innocent from my curse, when thou shalt come to my kin, and they will not give her thee.\n"
	"I came therefore today to the well of water, and said: O Lord God of my lord Abraham, if thou hast directed my way, wherein I now walk,\n"
	"behold I stand besides the well of water, and the virgin, that shall come forth to draw water, when she shall hear me say: Give me a little water to drink of thy tankard;\n"
	"and she shall say to me: Drink both thou and for thy camels I will draw also; that is the woman, which our Lord hath prepared for my master's son.\n"
	"And whilst I pondered these things secretly with myself, Rebecca appeared coming with a tankard, which she carried upon her shoulder: & she went down to the fountain, & drew water.\n"
	"And I said to her: Give me a little to drink. Who speedily let down the tankard from her shoulder, and said to me: Drink Both thou, and to thy camels I will give drink. I drank, and she watered the camels.\n"
	"And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou? Who answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Nachor, whom Melcha bare him. I hung therefore earlets to adorn her face, and I put bracelets upon her hands.\n"
	"And prostrate I adored our Lord, blessing the Lord God of my lord Abraham, who hath brought me the straight way to take the daughter of my lord's brother for his son.\n"
	"Wherefore if you do according to mercy and truth with my lord, shew me: but if it please you otherwise, that also tell me, that I may go to the right hand or to the left.\n"
	"And Laban and Bathuel answered: From our Lord the word hath proceeded: we cannot speak any other thing with thee besides his pleasure.\n"
	"Behold Rebecca is before thee, take her and go thy ways, & let her be the wife of thy lord's son, as our Lord hath spoken\n"
	"Which when Abraham's servant heard, falling down he adored our Lord to the ground.\n"
	"And taking forth vessels of silver, and gold, and garments, gave them to Rebecca for a present. To her brothers also, and to her mother he offered gifts.\n"
	"A banquet was made, and eating and drinking together they lodged there. And in the morning the servant arose, and said: Dismiss me, that I may go to my lord.\n"
	"And her brother and mother answered: Let the maid tarry at the least ten days with us, & after she shall depart.\n"
	"Stay me not, said he, because our Lord hath directed my way: dismiss me that I may go on to my lord.\n"
	"And they said: Let us call the maid, and ask her will.\n"
	"And being called, when she was come, they asked: Wilt thou go with this man? Who said: I will go.\n"
	"They dismissed her therefore, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his company,\n"
	"wishing prosperity to their sister, and saying: Thou art our sister, increase thou into thousand thousands, and thy seed possess the gates of their enemies.\n"
	"Therefore Rebecca and her maids being set upon camels, followed the man: who with speed returned unto his lord; and\n"
	"the same time Isaac walked along the way, that leadeth to the well of the Living and the seeing, so called; for he dwelt in the south country:\n"
	"and he was gone forth to meditate in the field, the day now being well spent: and when he head cast up his eyes, he saw camels coming a far off.\n"
	"Rebecca also, when she saw Isaac, lighted off the camel,\n"
	"and said to the servant: Who is that man which cometh towards us along the field? And he said to her: The same is my lord. But she quickly taking her cloak, covered herself.\n"
	"And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.\n"
	"Who brought her into the tent of Sara his mother, & took her to wife: and he loved her so much, that it did moderate the sorrow which was chanced of his mother's death.";

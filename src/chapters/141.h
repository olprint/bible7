const char* chap141 = "And when Balaam had seen that it pleased our Lord that he should bless Israel, he went not as before he had gone, to seek soothsaying: but directing his countenance against the desert,\n"
	"and lifting up his eyes, he saw Israel abiding in their tents by their tribes: and the spirit of God coming vehemently upon him,\n"
	"taking up his parable he said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man hath said whose eye is stopped:\n"
	"The hearer of the words of God hath said, he that hath beholden the vision of the Omnipotent, he that falleth, and so his eyes are opened:\n"
	"How beautiful are thy tabernacles, o Jacob, and thy tents, o Israel!\n"
	"As woody valleys, as watered gardens beside the rivers, as tabernacles which the Lord hath pitched, as cedars by the waters' side.\n"
	"Water shall flow out of his bucket, and his seed shall be into many waters. For Agag shall his king be taken away, and his kingdom shall be taken away.\n"
	"God hath brought him out of Aegypt, whose strength is like to the Rhinoceros. They shall devour nations his enemies, and break their bones, and pierce them with arrows.\n"
	"Lying^ he hath slept as a lion, and as a lioness, whom none shall be bold to raise up. He that blesseth thee, himself also shall be blessed: he that curseth thee, shall be reputed accurst.\n"
	"And Balac being angry against Balaam, clapping his hands together said: To curse mine enemies I called thee, whom thou contrary wise hast blessed the third time:\n"
	"return to thy place. I was determined verily to honour thee magnifically, but the Lord hath deprived thee of the honour appointed.\n"
	"Balaam made answer to Balac: did I not say to thy messengers, whom thou didst send to me:\n"
	"If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot pass the word of the Lord my God, to utter of my own mind either any good, or evil: but whatsoever the Lord shall say, that will I speak?\n"
	"But yet going to my people, I will give thee counsel, what thy people shall do to this people in the last time.\n"
	"Therefore taking up his parable, again he said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man whose eye is stopped, hath said:\n"
	"the hearer of the words of God hath said, who knoweth the doctrine of the Highest, and seeth the visions of the Omnipotent, who falling hath his eyes opened:\n"
	"I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him but not near. A STAR SHALL RISE out of Jacob, and a rod shall arise from Israel: and shall strike the Dukes of Moab, and shall waste all the children of Seth.\n"
	"And Idumea shall be his possession: the inheritance of Seir shall come to their enemies: but Israel shall do manfully.\n"
	"Of Jacob shall he be that shall rule, and shall destroy the remains of the city.\n"
	"And when he had seen Amalec, taking up his parable, he said: Amalec the beginning of Gentiles, whose latter ends shall be destroyed.\n"
	"He saw also the Cineite: and taking up his parable, he said: Thy habitation indeed is strong: but if thou build thy nest in a rock,\n"
	"and thou be chosen of the stock of Cin, how long shalt thou be able to continue? For Assur shall take thee.\n"
	"And taking up his parable again he spake: Alas, who shall live, when God shall do these things?\n"
	"They shall come in galleys from Italy, they shall overcome the Assyrians, and shall waste the Hebrews, and at the last themselves also shall perish.\n"
	"And Balaam rose, and returned into his place: Balac also returned the way that he came.";

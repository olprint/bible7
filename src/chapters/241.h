And the towns and fields bubbled forth in the midst of that country, and there came forth mice, and there was confusion of great death in the city.\n"

	"For there was made the fear of death in every city, and the hand of God exceeding grievous. The men also that had not died, were strucken in the secret part of the buttocks: and the howling of every city went up into heaven.";

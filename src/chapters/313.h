const char* chap313 = "There passed therefore three years without war between Syria and Israel.\n"
	"And in the third year, Josaphat the king of Juda went down to the king of Israel.\n"
	"(And the king of Israel said to his servants: are you ignorant that Ramoth Galaad is ours, and we neglect to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?)\n"
	"And he said to Josaphat: Wilt thou come with me to fight into Ramoth Galaad?\n"
	"And Josaphat said to the king of Israel: As I am, so thou also: my people and thy people are one: and my horsemen thy horsemen. And Josaphat said to the king of Israel: Ask, I beseech thee, this day the word of our Lord.\n"
	"The king of Israel therefore assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and he said to them: Shall I go into Ramoth Galaad to fight, or sit still? Who answered: Go up, and our Lord will give it into the king's hand.\n"
	"And Josaphat said: Is there not here some prophet of our Lord, that we may ask by him?\n"
	"And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: There is one man left, by whom we may ask our Lord: but I hate him, because he doeth not prophesy unto me good, but evil, Micheas the son of Jemla. To whom Josaphat said: Speak not so, o king.\n"
	"The king of Israel therefore called a certain eunuch, and said to him: Make haste, and bring hither Micheas the son of Jemla.\n"
	"And the king of Israel, and Josaphat the king of Juda sat each in his throne clothed with royal attire, in a court beside the door of the gate of Samaria, & all the Prophets prophesied before them.\n"
	"And Sedecias the son of Chanaana made himself horns of iron, and said: Thus saith our Lord: With these shalt thou strike Syria, till thou destroy it.\n"
	"And all the prophets in like manner prophesied, saying: Ascend into Ramoth Galaad, and go prosperously, & our Lord will deliver into the king's hands.\n"
	"But the messenger, that went to call Micheas, spake to him, saying: Behold the words of the prophets with one mouth preach good things to the king: let thy word therefore be like to theirs, and speak good things.\n"
	"To whom Micheas said: Our Lord liveth, whatsoever our Lord shall tell me, that will I speak.\n"
	"He therefore came to the king, and the king, said to him: Micheas, shall we go into Ramoth Galaad to fight, or sit still? To whom he answered: Ascend, and go prosperously, and our Lord will deliver it into the king's hands.\n"
	"But the king said to him: I adjure thee again and again, that thou speak not to me but that which is true in the name of our Lord.\n"
	"And he said: I saw all Israel dispersed in the mountains, as sheep not having a shepherd, and our Lord said: These have no master, let every man return into his house in peace.\n"
	"(Therefore the king of Israel said to Josaphat: Did I not tell thee, that he doth not Prophesy me good, but always evil?)\n"
	"But he adding, said: Therefore hear the word of our Lord: I saw our Lord sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven assisting him on the right hand and on the left:\n"
	"and our Lord said: Who shall deceive Achab the king of Israel, that he may go up, and fall in Ramoth Galaad? And one saith these manner of words, and another otherwise.\n"
	"And there came forth a spirit, and stood before our Lord, and said: I will deceive him. To whom our Lord spake: Wherein?\n"
	"And he said: I will go forth, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And our Lord said: Thou shalt deceive, and shalt prevail: go forth, and do so.\n"
	"Now therefore behold our Lord hath given the spirit of lying in the mouth of all thy prophets, that are here, and our Lord hath spoken evil against thee.\n"
	"And Sedecias the son of Chanaana came, and smote Micheas on the cheek, and said: Hath the Spirit of our Lord left me, and hath it spoken to thee?\n"
	"And Micheas said: Thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt enter into thy chamber, within the chamber to be hid.\n"
	"And the king of Israel said: Take Micheas, & let him tarry with Amon the governor of the city, and with Joas the son of Amelech,\n"
	"and tell them: Thus saith the king: Cast this man into prison, and feed him with bread of tribulation, and water of distress, till I return in peace.\n"
	"And Micheas said: If thou return in peace, our Lord hath not spoken in me. And he said: Hear all ye peoples.\n"
	"Therefore the king of Israel went up, and Josaphat the king of Juda into Ramoth Galaad.\n"
	"The king of Israel therefore said to Josaphat: Take armour, and go into the battle, and put on thine own garments. Moreover the king of Israel changed his habit, and went into the battle.\n"
	"And the king of Syria had commanded the princes of his chariots thirty and two, saying: You shall not fight against any lesser, or greater, but against the king of Israel only.\n"
	"When therefore the Princes of the chariots had seen Josaphat, they suspected that he was the king of Israel, & making a violent assault they fought against him: and Josaphat cried out.\n"
	"And the Princes of the chariots perceived that he was not the king of Israel, and they ceased from him.\n"
	"And a certain man bent his bow; directing the arrow at all adventure, and by chance he struck the king of Israel between the lungs and the stomach. But he said to his coacher: Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the army, because I am grievously wounded.\n"
	"The battle therefore was fought that day, and the king of Israel stood in his chariot against the Syrians, and he died in the evening: and the blood of the wound ran into the midst of the chariot,\n"
	"and the herald sounded in all the army before the sun set, saying: Every man return into his city, and into his country.\n"
	"And the king died, and was carried into Samaria: and they buried the king in Samaria,\n"
	"& washed his chariot in the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked his blood, and they washed the reins of the bridle, according to the word of our Lord which he had spoken.\n"
	"But the rest of the words of Achab, and all that he did, and the house of ivory that he built, and of all the cities that he built, are not these things written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?\n"
	"Achab therefore slept with his fathers, and Ochozias his son reigned for him.\n"
	"But Josaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Juda the fourth year of Achab the king of Israel.\n"
	"Five and thirty years old was he when he began to reign, and five and twenty years he reigned in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Azuba the daughter of Salai.\n"
	"And he walked in all the way of Asa his father, and he declined not from it: and he did that which was right in the sight of our Lord.\n"
	"But yet he took not away the excelses: for as yet the people did sacrifice, and burnt incense in the excelses.\n"
	"And Josaphat had peace with the king of Israel.\n"
	"But the rest of the words of Josaphat, and his works, which he did, and his battles, are not these things written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?\n"
	"Yea and the remnant of the effeminate, which remained in the days of Asa his father, he took out of the land.\n"
	"Neither was there then a king appointed in Edom.\n"
	"But king Josaphat had made navies on the sea, which should sail into Ophir for gold: and they could not go, because they were broken in Asiongaber.\n"
	"Then said Ochozias the son of Achab to Josaphat: Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. And Josaphat would not.\n"
	"And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the City of David his father: and Joram his son reigned for him.\n"
	"And Ochozias the son of Achab began to reign over Israel in Samaria, in the seventeenth year of Josaphat the king of Juda, and he reigned over Israel two years.\n"
	"And he did evil in the sight of our Lord, and walked in the way of his father and his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin.\n"
	"He served also Baal, and adored him, and provoked our Lord the God of Israel, according to all things which his father had done.";

const char* chap316 = "And Joram the son of Achab reigned over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Josaphat the king of Juda. And he reigned twelve years.\n"
	"And he did evil before our Lord, but not as his father and mother: for he took away the statues of Baal, which his father had made.\n"
	"Nevertheless in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, he struck fast, and departed not from them.\n"
	"Moreover Mesa the king of Moab, nourished many sheep, & he payed to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams with their fleeces.\n"
	"And when Achab was dead, he brake the league, which he had made with the king of Israel.\n"
	"Therefore king Joram went forth that day out of Samaria, and mustered all Israel.\n"
	"And he sent to Josaphat the king of Juda. Saying: The king of Moab is revolted from me, come with me against him to battle. Who answered: I will come up: he that is mine is thine: my people, thy people, & my horses thy horses.\n"
	"And he said: What way shall we go up? But he answered: By the desert of Idumea.\n"
	"Therefore the king of Israel, and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom went forward, and compassed seven days' journey, neither was there water for the army, and the beasts that followed them.\n"
	"And the king of Israel said: Alas alas alas, our Lord hath gathered us three kings together, that he might deliver us into the hands of Moab.\n"
	"And Josaphat said: Is there not here a prophet of our Lord, that we may beseech our Lord by him? And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered: Here is Eliseus the son of Saphat, which poured water upon the hands of Elias.\n"
	"And Josaphat said: The word of our Lord is with him. And the king of Israel went down to him, and Josaphat the king of Juda, and the king of Edom.\n"
	"And Eliseus said to the king of Israel: What is to me and thee? Go to the prophets of thy father, and thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him: Why hath our Lord gathered together these three kings, that he might deliver them into the hands of Moab?\n"
	"And Eliseus said to him: The Lord of hosts liveth, in whose sight I stand, If I did not reverence the face of Josaphat the king of Juda, I would not certes have harkened to thee. Nor looked on thee.\n"
	"But now bring me hither a player on instruments. And when the player sang, the hand of our Lord came upon him, & he said:\n"
	"Thus saith our Lord: Make the channel of this torrent ditches and ditches.\n"
	"For thus saith our Lord: You shall not see wind, nor rain: and this channel shall be filled with waters, & you shall drink, and your families, & your beasts.\n"
	"And this is a small thing in the sight of our Lord: Moreover he will deliver also Moab into your hands.\n"
	"And you shall strike every fenced city, and every principal city, and shall cut down all fruitful trees, and shall stop up all fountains of waters, and every goodly field you shall cover with stones.\n"
	"It came to pass therefore in the morning, when they used to offer the sacrifice, and behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the ground was filled with waters.\n"
	"But all the Moabites hearing that the kings were come up to fight against them, they called together all that were girded with a belt upon them, and they stood in the borders.\n"
	"And rising early in the morning, and the sun being now risen over-against the waters, the Moabites saw the waters over against them red, as it were blood,\n"
	"and said: It is the blood of the swords: the kings have fought among themselves, and are slain one of another: now go on forward to the prey, Moab.\n"
	"And they went forward into the camp of Israel: Moreover Israel rising up, struck Moab: but they fled before them. They therefore that had overcome, came and struck Moab,\n"
	"and destroyed the cities: and every principal field they filled every man casting stones: and they stopt up all the fountains of waters: and cut down all trees that bare fruit, so that there remained only brick walls: and the city was beset of the slingers, and for a great part thereof was strucken.\n"
	"Which when the king of Moab had seen, to wit, that the enemies had prevailed, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break in upon the king of Edom: & they could not.\n"
	"And taking his first begotten son, that should have reigned for him, he offered him an holocaust upon the wall: and there was great indignation in Israel, and forthwith they retired from him, and returned into their country.";

	"And David said: I will do mercy with Hanon the son of Naas, as his father hath done mercy with me. David therefore sent, comforting him by his servants upon his father's death. But when the servants of David were come into the land of the children of Ammon,\n"
	"the Princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon their lord: Thinkest thou that for the honour of thy father, David hath sent comforters unto thee, and not rather that he might search and spy into the city, and overthrow it, hath David sent his servants unto thee?\n"
	"Hanon therefore took the servants of David, and shaved the one half of their beard, and cut away half their garments unto the buttocks, and sent them away.\n"
	"Which when it was told David, he sent to meet them: for the men were confounded very foully, and David commanded them: Tarry in Jericho, till your beard be grown, and then return.\n"
	"And the children of Ammon seeing that they had done injury to David, sent, and hired for wages the Syrian of Rohob, and the Syrian of Soba, twenty thousand footmen, and of the king Maacha a thousand men, and of Istob twelve thousand men.\n"
	"Which when David had heard, he sent Joab and the whole army of warriors.\n"
	"The children therefore of Ammon issued forth, and set their men in array before the very entrance of the gate: but the Syrian of Soba, and Rohob, and Istob, and Maacha were by themselves in the field.\n"
	"Joab therefore seeing that there was battle prepared against him, both before him and behind him, he picked out of all the chosen of Israel, and directed his army against the Syrian:\n"
	"and the rest of the people he delivered to Abisai his brother, who directed his army against the children of Ammon.\n"
	"And Joab said: If the Syrian shall prevail against me, thou shalt aid me: and if the children of Ammon shall prevail against thee, I will aid thee.\n"
	"Play the man, and let us fight for our people, and the city of our God: and our Lord will do that which is good in his sight.\n"
	"Joab therefore and the people that were with him, began to fight against the Syrians: Who immediately fled from his face.\n"
	"And the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrians were fled, they also fled from the face of Abisai, and entered into the city: and Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.\n"
	"Therefore the Syrians seeing that they were fallen before Israel, they gathered themselves together.\n"
	"And Adarezer sent, and fetched out the Syrians, that were beyond the river, and brought their army: and Sobach the master of Adarezer's war, was their chief captain.\n"
	"Which when it was told David, he gathered together all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came into Helam: and the Syrians put themselves in array against David, & fought against him.\n"
	"And the Syrians fled from the face of Israel, and David slew of the Syrians seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen: and Sobach the Prince of the war he struck: who forthwith died.\n"
	"And all the kings that were to aid Adarezer, seeing themselves overcome of Israel, were afraid and fled, eight and fifty thousand before Israel. And they made peace with Israel: and served them, and the Syrians were afraid any more to aid the children of Ammon.";

	"Now also my talk is in bitterness, and the hand of my plague is aggravated upon my mourning.\n"
	"Who will grant me that I may know and find him, & come even to his throne?\n"
	"I will set judgement before him, and will fill my mouth with accusations.\n"
	"That I may know the words that he will answer me, and understand what he will speak to me.\n"
	"I will not that he contend with me with much strength, nor that he oppress me with the weight of his greatness.\n"
	"Let him propose equity against me, and my judgment shall come to victory.\n"
	"If I shall go to the East, he appeareth not: if to the West, I shall not understand him.\n"
	"If to the left hand, what shall I do? I shall not apprehend him: if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him.\n"

	"God hath mollified my heart, and the Omnipotent hath troubled me.\n"
	"For I have not perished because of the imminent darkness, neither hath the mist covered my face.";

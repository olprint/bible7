	"when Nathan the Prophet came to him, after that he had sinned with Bethsabee\n"
	"Have mercy on me, o God, according to thy great mercy. And according to the multitude of thy commiserations, take away mine iniquity.\n"
	"Wash me more amply from mine iniquity: & cleanse me from my sin.\n"
	"Because I do know mine iniquity: and my sin is before me always.\n"
	"To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: that thou mayst be justified in thy word, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.\n"
	"For behold I was conceived in iniquities: & my mother conceived me in sins.\n"
	"For behold thou hast loved truth: the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.\n"
	"Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.\n"
	"To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness, and the bones humbled shall rejoice.\n"
	"Turn away thy face from my sins: and wipe away all mine iniquities.\n"
	"Create a clean heart in me, o God: and renew a right spirit in my bowels.\n"
	"Cast me not away from thy face: and thy Holy spirit take not from me.\n"
	"Render unto me the joy of thy salvation? And confirm me with the principal spirit.\n"
	"I will teach the unjust thy ways: and the impious shall be converted to thee.\n"
	"Deliver me from bloods, o God, the God of my salvation: and my tongue shall exult thy justice.\n"
	"Lord thou wilt open my lips: & my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.\n"
	"Because if thou wouldest have had sacrifice, I had verily given it: with holocausts thou wilt not be delighted.\n"
	"A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: a contrite and humbled heart, o God, thou wilt not despise.\n"
	"Deal favourably, o Lord, in thy good will with Sion: that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.\n"
	"Then shall thou accept sacrifice of justice, oblations, & holocausts: then shall they lay calves upon thine altar.";

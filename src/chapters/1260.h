	"For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from fornication,\n"
	"that every one may know to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour:\n"
	"not in the passion of lust, as also the Gentiles that know not God,\n"
	"and that no man over-go, nor circumvent his brother in business: because our Lord is revenger of all these things, as we have foretold you, and have testified.\n"
	"For God hath not called us into uncleanness, but into sanctification.\n"

	"For this we say to you in the word of our Lord, that we which live, which are remaining in the advent of our Lord, shall not prevent them that have slept.\n"
	"For our Lord himself in commandment, and in the voice of an Archangel, & in the trumpet of God will descend from heaven: and the dead that are in Christ, shall rise again first.\n"
	"Then we that live, that are left, withal shall be taken up with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air, and so always we shall be with our Lord.\n"
	"Therefore comfort ye one another in these words.";

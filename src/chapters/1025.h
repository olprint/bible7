	"If a man take sanctified flesh in the skirt of his garment, and touch with the skirt thereof bread, or broth, or wine, or oil, or any meat: shall it be sanctified? And the Priests answering, said: No.\n"
	"And Aggeus said: If one polluted on a soul touch any of all these, shall he be contaminated? And the Priests answered, and said: He shall be contaminated.\n"
	"And Aggeus answered, and said: So this people, and so this nation before my face, saith our Lord, and so all the work of their hands: & all that they have offered there, shall be contaminated.\n"

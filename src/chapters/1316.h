const char* chap1316 = "AFTER these things I looked, & behold a door open in heaven, and the first voice which I heard, was as it were of a trumpet speaking with me, saying: Come up hither, and I will shew thee the things which must be done quickly after these.\n"
	"And immediately I was in spirit: and behold there was a seat set in heaven, and upon the seat one sitting.\n"
	"And he that sat, was like in sight, to the Jasper stone, and the Sardine: and there was a rain-bow round about the seat, like to the sight of an Emerald.\n"
	"And round about the seat, four and twenty seats: and upon the thrones, four and twenty Seniors sitting, clothed about in white garments, and on their heads crowns of gold.\n"
	"And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders: and seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.\n"
	"And in the sight of the seat, as it were a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the midst of the seat and round about the seat four beasts full of eyes before and behind.\n"
	"And the first beast, like to a lion: and the second beast, like to a calf, and the third beast, having the face as it were of a man: and the fourth beast, like to an eagle flying.\n"
	"And the four beasts, every one of them had six wings round about: and within they are full of eyes. And they had no rest day and night, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God omnipotent, which was, and which is, and which shall come.\n"
	"And when those beasts gave glory and honour and benediction to him that sitteth upon the throne, that liveth for ever and ever:\n"
	"the four and twenty Seniors fell down before him that sitteth in the throne, & adored him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:\n"
	"Thou art worthy O Lord our God to receive glory and honour and power: because thou hast created all things, and for thy will they were and have been created.";

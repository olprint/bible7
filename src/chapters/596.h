	"O God who shall be like to thee? Hold not thy peace, neither be thou appeased, o God:\n"
	"for behold thine enemies have made a sound: they that hate thee have lifted up the head.\n"
	"They have taken malignant counsel upon thy people: and they have devised against thy Saints.\n"
	"They have said: Come, and let us destroy them out of the nation: and let the name of Israel be remembered no more.\n"
	"Because they have devised with one consent: they have together made a covenant against thee.\n"

	"My God put them as a wheel: and as stubble before the face of the wind.\n"
	"Even as fire that burneth a wood: & as a flame that burneth the mountains.\n"
	"So shalt thou pursue them in thy tempest: and in thy wrath thou shalt trouble them.\n"
	"Fill their faces with ignominy: and they will seek thy name, o Lord.\n"
	"Let them be ashamed, and troubled for ever and ever: and let them be confounded, and perish.\n"

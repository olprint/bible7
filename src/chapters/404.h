	"Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians: All the Kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord the God of heaven given me, and he hath commanded me that I should build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Jewry.\n"
	"Who is there among you of all his people? His God be with him. Let him go up into Jerusalem, which is in Jewry, and build the house of the Lord the God of Israel, he is the God that is in Jerusalem.\n"

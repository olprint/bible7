	"one you shall offer in the morning, and the other at even:\n"
	"the tenth part of an ephi of flour, which shall be tempered with the purest oil, and shall have the fourth part of an hin.\n"
	"It is the continual holocaust which you offered in Mount Sinai for a most sweet odour of the burnt sacrifice of the Lord.\n"
	"and for a libament you shall offer of wine the fourth part of an hin for every lamb in the Sanctuary of the Lord.\n"
	"And the other lamb in like manner you shall offer at even according to all the rite of the morning sacrifice, and of the libaments thereof, an oblation of most sweet odour to the Lord.\n"

	"to a man that is at rest, and whose ways are prosperous in all things, and that is yet able to take meat!\n"
	"O death, thy judgement is good to a needy man, and him that is diminished in strength,\n"
	"and faileth in age, and that is careful of all things, and to the incredulous, that loseth patience!\n"
	"Fear not the judgement of death. Remember what things have been before thee, and what come after thee: this is the judgement from our Lord to all flesh:\n"
	"and what shall come upon thee by the good pleasure of the Highest? Whether it be ten, or an hundred, or a thousand years.\n"
	"For in hell there is no accusing of life.\n"

	"Woe to you ye impious men, which have forsaken the law of our Lord the Highest.\n"

	"Children, keep ye discipline in peace. For wisdom hid, and treasure not seen, what profit is there in them both?\n"
	"Better is the man that hideth his folly, than the man that hideth his wisdom.\n"
	"But yet have reverence to these things, which proceed from my mouth.\n"
	"For it is not good to observe all shamefastness: & all things do not please all men in opinion.\n"
	"Be ashamed before father & before mother, of fornication: and before the president and before the mighty, of lying:\n"

	"before companion and friend, of injustice: and before the place where thou dwellest,\n"
	"of theft, of the truth of God, and his testament: of leaning on the bread, and of reproof for the thing given and taken:\n"

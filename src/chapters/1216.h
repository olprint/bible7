const char* chap1216 = "AM I not free? Am I not an Apostle? Have I not seen Christ JESUS our Lord? Are not you my work in our Lord?\n"
	"And if to others I be not an Apostle, but yet to you I am. For you are the seal of my Apostleship in our Lord.\n"
	"my defence to them that examine me is this.\n"
	"Have not we power to eat and drink?\n"
	"Have we not power to lead about a woman a sister, as also the rest of the Apostles, and our Lord's brethren, and Cephas?\n"
	"Or I only and Barnabas have not we power to do this?\n"
	"Who ever playeth the soldier at his own charges? who planteth a vine, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?\n"
	"Speak I these things according to man? Or doth not the Law also say these things?\n"
	"For it is written in the Law of Moyses: Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Why, hath God care of oxen?\n"
	"Or for us certes doth he say it? For they are written for us. Because he that eareth, ought to ear in hope: and he that treadeth, in hope to receive fruit.\n"
	"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?\n"
	"If other be partakers of your power; why not we rather? Howbeit we have not used, this power: but we bear all things, lest we should give any offence to the Gospel of Christ.\n"
	"Know you not that they which work in the holy place, eat the things that are of the holy place: and they that serve the altar, participate with the altar?\n"
	"So also our Lord ordained for them that preach the Gospel, to live of the Gospel.\n"
	"But I have used none of these. Neither have I written these things, that they should be so done in me; for it is good for me to die rather, than that any man should make my glory void.\n"
	"For & if I evangelize, it is no glory to me: for necessity lieth upon me: for woe is to me if I evangelize not.\n"
	"For if I do this willingly, I have reward: but if against my will, a charge is committed to me.\n"
	"What is my reward then? That preaching the Gospel, I yield the Gospel without cost, that I abuse not my power in the Gospel.\n"
	"For whereas I was free of all, I made myself the servant of all: that I might gain the more.\n"
	"And I became to the Jews as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews.\n"
	"To them that are under the Law, as though I were under the Law (whereas myself was not under the Law) that I might gain them that were under the Law. To them that were without the Law, as though I were without the Law (whereas I was not without the law of God, but was in the law of Christ) that I might gain them that were without the Law.\n"
	"To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. To all men I became all things, that I might save all.\n"
	"And I do all things for the Gospel, that I may be made partaker thereof.\n"
	"Know you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the prize? So run that you may obtain.\n"
	"And every one the striveth for the mastery, refraineth himself from all things: and they certes, that they may receive a corruptible crown: but we an incorruptible.\n"
	"I therefore so run, not as it were at an uncertain thing: so I fight, not as it were beating the air:\n"
	"But I chastise my body, and bring it into servitude, lest perhaps when I have preached to others, myself become reprobate.";

const char* chap125 = "And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying:\n"
	"Speak to Aaron, and thou shalt say to him: When thou shalt place the seven lamps, let the candlestick be set up in the south part over against the north, toward the table of the breads of proposition, over against that part toward which the candlestick looketh, shall they shine.\n"
	"And Aaron did so, and he put the lamps upon the candlestick, as our Lord had commanded Moyses.\n"
	"This was the making of the candlestick, of beaten gold, as well the middle shaft, as all things that arose out of both sides of the branches: according to the example which our Lord shewed to Moyses, so wrought he the candlestick.\n"
	"And our Lord spake to Moyses saying:\n"
	"Take the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel, and thou shalt purify them,\n"
	"according to this rite: Let them be sprinkled with the water of lustration, and shave all the hairs of their flesh. And when they have washed their garments, & are cleansed,\n"
	"they shall take an oxe out of the herds, & his libament flour tempered with oil: & another oxe out of the herd thou shalt take for sin:\n"
	"& thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of covenant, calling together all the multitude of the children of Israel.\n"
	"And when the Levites are before the Lord, the children of Israel shall put their hands upon them.\n"
	"and Aaron shall offer the Levites, a gift in the sight of the Lord from the children of Israel, that they may serve in his ministry.\n"
	"The Levites also shall put their hands upon the heads of the oxen, of the which thou shalt make one for sin, and the other for holocaust of the Lord, to pray for them.\n"
	"And thou shalt set the Levites in the sight of Aaron and of his sons, and being offered shall consecrate them to the Lord,\n"
	"and shall separate them from the midst of the children of Israel, to be mine.\n"
	"And afterward they shall enter into the tabernacle of covenant, to serve me. And thou shalt so purify and consecrate them for an oblation of the Lord: because they were given me for a gift of the children of Israel.\n"
	"For the first born that open every matrice in Israel, I have taken them.\n"
	"For mine are all the first born of the children of Israel, as well of men as of beasts. From the day that I smote every first born in the Land of Aegypt, have I sanctified them to me:\n"
	"and I have taken the Levites for all the first born of the children of Israel:\n"
	"and have delivered them for a gift to Aaron and his sons out of the midst of the people, to serve me for Israel in the tabernacle of covenant, & to pray for them, that there be no plague among the people, if they should presume to approach unto my Sanctuary.\n"
	"And Moyses & Aaron and all the multitude of the children of Israel did concerning the Levites the things that our Lord had commanded Moyses:\n"
	"and they were purified, and washed their garments. And Aaron elevated them in the sight of the Lord, and prayed for them,\n"
	"that being purified they might enter to their offices into the tabernacle of covenant before Aaron and his sons. Even as our Lord had commanded Moyses touching the Levites, so was it done.\n"
	"And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying:\n"
	"This is the law of the Levites: From twenty five years and upward, they shall enter in to minister in the tabernacle of covenant.\n"
	"And when they shall have accomplisheth the fiftieth year of their age, they shall cease to serve:\n"
	"and shall be the ministers of their brethren in the tabernacle of covenant, to keep the things that are commanded to them, but not to do the very works. Thus shalt thou dispose to the Levites in their custodies.";

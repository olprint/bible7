	"who hath given testimony to the word of God, and the testimony of JESUS Christ, what things soever he hath seen.\n"
	"Blessed is he that readeth and heareth the words of this prophecy: and keepeth those things which be written in it. For the time is nigh.\n"
	"John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace to you and peace from him that is, and that was, and that shall come, and from the seven spirits which are in the sight of his throne,\n"
	"and from JESUS Christ who is the faithful witness, the First-born of the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth, who hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his blood,\n"
	"and hath made us a Kingdom and Priests to God and his Father, to him be glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.\n"
	"Behold he cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they that pricked him. And all the tribes of the earth shall bewail themselves upon him. Yea, Amen.\n"
	"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and end, saith our Lord God, which is, and which was, and which shall come, the Omnipotent.\n"
	"I^ John your brother and partaker in tribulation, and the Kingdom, and patience in Christ JESUS, was in the Island, which is called Patmos, for the word of God and the testimony of JESUS.\n"
	"I was in spirit on the Dominical day, and heard behind me a great voice as it were of a trumpet\n"
	"saying: That which thou seest, write in a book: and send to the seven churches which are in Asia, to Ephesus, and Smyrna, and Pergamus, and Thiatira, and Sardis, and Philadelphia, and Laodicia.\n"
	"And I turned, to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned I saw seven candlesticks of gold:\n"
	"and in the midst of the seven candlesticks of gold, one like to the Son of man, vested in a priestly garment to the foot, & girded about near to the paps with a girdle of gold.\n"
	"And his head & hairs were white, as white wool, and as snow, and his eyes as the flame of fire.\n"
	"And his feet like to latten, as in a burning furnace. And his voice as the voice of many waters:\n"
	"and he had in his right hand seven stars. And from his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his face, as the sun shineth in his virtue.\n"
	"And when I had seen him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he put his right hand upon me, saying: Fear not. I am the First and the Last,\n"
	"and alive, and was dead, and behold I am living for ever and ever, and have the keys of death and of hell.\n"
	"Write therefore the things which thou hast seen, and that are, and that must be done after these:\n"
	"The Sacrament of the seven stars, which thou hast seen in my right hand, and the seven candlesticks of Gold. The seven stars, are the Angels of the seven Churches. And the seven candlesticks, are the seven Churches.";

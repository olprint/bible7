	"Whom when Sichem had seen, the son of Hemor the Hevite, the Prince of that land, he was in love with her: and he took her away, and lay with her, by force ravishing the virgin.\n"
	"And his soul was fast knit unto her, and whereas she was sad, he comforted her with sweet words.\n"
	"And going to Hemor his father, he said: Take me this wench to be my wife.\n"
	"Which when Jacob had heard, his sons being absent and occupied in feeding of the cattle, he held his peace till they returned.\n"
	"And when Hemor, Sichem's father was come forth to speak unto Jacob,\n"
	"behold his sons came out of the field; and hearing what had passed, they were passing wrath, because he had done a foul thing in Israel, and committed an unlawful fact in ravishing Jacob's daughter.\n"
	"Hemor therefore spake to them: The soul of my son Sichem is fastened to your daughter: Give her unto him to wife:\n"
	"and let us contract marriages one with another: give us your daughters, and take you our daughters.\n"
	"And dwell with us: the land is at your commandment, till, occupy, and possess it.\n"
	"Yea and Sichem also said to her father and to her brethren: Let me find grace in your sight: and what soever you shall appoint I will give:\n"
	"raise the dowry, and require gifts, and I shall gladly give what you shall demand: only give me this wench to wife.\n"
	"Jacob's sons answered Sichem & his father in guile, being wrath for the deflowering of their sister:\n"
	"We cannot do that which you demand, nor give our sister to an uncircumcised person; which with us is an unlawful & abominable thing.\n"
	"But in this order we may be considerate, if you will be like to us, and all the man sex among you be circumcised:\n"
	"then will we give and take mutually your daughters, and ours: and we will dwell with you, and will be one people:\n"
	"but if you will not be circumcised, we will take our daughter, and depart.\n"
	"The offer pleased Hemor and Sichem his son:\n"
	"neither did the young man make delay, but forthwith fulfilled that which was demanded: for he loved the wench exceedingly, and he was the greatest man in all his father's house.\n"
	"And going into the gate of the city, they spake to the people:\n"
	"These men are men of peace, and are willing to dwell with us: let them occupy in the land, and till it, which being large and wide doth lack men to till it: their daughters we shall take to wife, and ours we will give to them.\n"
	"One thing there is for the which so great a good is deferred: If we circumcise our man sex, following the rite of the nation.\n"
	"And their substance, and cattle, and all things that they possess, shall be ours: only in this let us condescend, and dwelling together we shall make one people\n"
	"And they all assented, and circumcised all the man sex.\n"
	"And behold the third day, when the grief of the wounds is most painful: Jacob's two sons Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina, taking their swords, entered into the city boldly: and killing all the man sex,\n"
	"murdered withal Hemor and Sichem, taking away Dina their sister out of Sichem's house.\n"
	"When they were gone forth, the other sons of Jacob ran in upon them that were slain, and spoiled the city in revenge of the rape.\n"
	"And wasting all things that were in their houses and fields, their sheep and herds, and asses,\n"
	"their little ones also, and their wives they led away captive.\n"
	"Which things when they had boldly achieved, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: You have troubled me, and made me odious to the Chananites, and Pherezites, the inhabiters of this land. We are few: they being gathered together will strike me; and I and my house shall be destroyed.\n"
	"They answered: What? Should they abuse our sister as a strumpet?";

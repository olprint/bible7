const char* chap263 = "And David said in his heart: at length I shall fall one day into the hands of Saul: is it not better that I fly, and be saved in the Land of the Philistians, that Saul may despair, and cease to seek me in all the coasts of Israel? I will fly therefore his hands.\n"
	"And David arose, and went himself, and the six hundred men with him, to Achis the son of Maoch, the king of Geth.\n"
	"And David dwelt with Achis in Geth, he & his men; every man & his house: & David & his two wives, Achinoam the Jezrahelite, & Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel.\n"
	"And it was told Saul that David was fled into Geth, and he added no more to seek him.\n"
	"And David said to Achis: If I have grace in thy sight, let there a place be given me in one of thy cities of this country, that I may dwell there: for why abideth thy servant in the city of the king with thee?\n"
	"Achis therefore gave him in that day Siceleg: for which cause Siceleg became the kings' of Juda until this day.\n"
	"And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistians, was four months.\n"
	"And David went up, and his men, and drave preys out of Gessuri, and Gerzi, and from the Amalecites: for these villages were inhabited in the land in old time, as men go to Sur, as far as the Land of Aegypt.\n"
	"And David struck all the land, neither left he any man or woman: and taking the sheep, & oxen, and asses, & camels, and garments, he returned & came to Achis.\n"
	"And Achis said to him: Whom hast thou set upon today? David answered: Against the south of Juda, and against the south of Ieramiel, and against the south of Ceni.\n"
	"David gave life neither to man nor woman, neither brought them into Geth, saying: Lest perhaps they speak against us. These things did David, and this was decreed of him all the days that he dwelt in the country of the Philistians.\n"
	"Achis therefore did credit David, saying: Many evils hath he wrought against his people Israel: Therefore he shall be my servant for ever.";

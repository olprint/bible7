const char* chap296 = "Hiram also the king of Tyre sent his servants to Salomon: for he heard that they had anointed him king for his father: because Hiram had been David's friend at all time.\n"
	"And Salomon sent to Hiram, saying:\n"
	"Thou knowest the will of David my father, and that he could not build a house to the name of our Lord his God, because of wars imminent round about, until our Lord put them under the sole of his feet.\n"
	"But now our Lord my God hath given me rest round about: and there is no satan, nor ill rencounter.\n"
	"Wherefore I purpose to build a temple to the name of our Lord my God, as our Lord hath spoken to David my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will give for thee upon thy throne, he shall build a house to my name.\n"
	"Command therefore that thy servants cut me down cedars out of Libanus, and let my servants be with thy servants: and I will give thee the hire of thy servants whatsoever thou wilt ask, for thou knowest how there is not in my people a man that hath skill to hew wood as the Sidonians.\n"
	"When Hiram therefore had heard the words of Salomon, he rejoiced exceedingly, and said: Blessed be the Lord God this day, who hath given unto David a son most wise over this people so great in number.\n"
	"And Hiram sent to Salomon, saying: I have heard whatsoever thou hast willed me: I will do all thy will in cedar trees, and fir trees.\n"
	"My servants shall bring them down from Libanus to the sea: and I will put them in boats in the sea, unto the place which thou shalt signify to me; & will land them there, and thou shalt take them: and thou shalt allow me necessaries, that there be meat given for my house.\n"
	"Therefore Hiram gave Salomon cedar trees, and fir trees, according to all his will.\n"
	"And Salomon allowed Hiram twenty thousand cores of wheat, for provision for his house, and twenty cores of most pure oil: these things did Salomon give to Hiram every year.\n"
	"Our Lord also gave wisdom to Salomon, as he spake to him: & there was peace between Hiram & Salomon, and both made a league.\n"
	"And king Salomon chose workmen out of all Israel, and the taxed number was of thirty thousand men.\n"
	"And he sent them into Libanus, ten thousand every month by course, so that two months they were in their houses: and Adoniram was over this taxing.\n"
	"And Salomon had seventy thousand of them that carried burdens, and eighty thousand hewers of stones in the mountains:\n"
	"besides the overseers which were over every work, in number three thousand, and three hundred that commanded the people, & them that did the work.\n"
	"And the king commanded, that they should take great stones, chosen stones for the foundation of the temple, and should square them:\n"
	"which the masons of Salomon, and masons of Hiram hewed: moreover the Giblians prepared timber and stones, to build the house.";

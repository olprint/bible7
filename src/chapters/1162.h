	"She ran therefore and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other Disciple whom JESUS loved, and saith to them: They have taken our Lord out of the monument, and we know not where they have laid him.\n"
	"Peter therefore went forth and that other Disciple, and they came to the monument.\n"
	"And both ran together, and that other Disciple did out-run Peter, and came first to the monument.\n"
	"And when he had stooped down, he saw the linen cloths lying: but yet he went not in.\n"
	"Simon Peter therefore cometh, following him, and went into the monument and saw the linen cloths lying,\n"
	"and the napkin that had been upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but apart, wrapped up into one place.\n"
	"Then therefore went in that other Disciple also which came first to the monument: and he saw, and believed.\n"
	"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he should rise again from the dead.\n"
	"The Disciples therefore departed again to themselves.\n"
	"But Mary stood at the monument without, weeping. Therefore as she was weeping, she stooped down, & looked into the monument:\n"
	"and she saw two Angels in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of JESUS had been laid.\n"
	"They say to her: Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them: Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have put him.\n"
	"When she had said thus, she turned backward, and saw JESUS standing; and she knew not that it is JESUS.\n"
	"JESUS saith to her: Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She thinking that it was the gardener, saith to him: Sir, if thou hast carried him away, tell me where thou hast laid him; and I will take him away.\n"
	"JESUS saith to her: Mary. She turning saith to him: Rabboni (which is to say, Master.)\n"
	"JESUS said to her: Do not touch me, for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my Brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, my God and your God.\n"
	"Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the Disciples, That I have seen our Lord, and thus he said unto me.\n"
	"Therefore when it was late that day, the first of the Sabboths, and the doors were shut, where the Disciples were gathered together for fear of the Jews, JESUS came and stood in the midst, and saith to them: Peace be to you.\n"
	"And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and side. The Disciples therefore were glad when they saw our Lord.\n"
	"He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As my Father hath sent me, I also do send you.\n"
	"When he had said this: he breathed upon them; and he said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost:\n"
	"WHOSE SINS YOU SHALL FORGIVE, THEY ARE FORGIVEN THEM: AND WHOSE YOU SHALL RETAIN, THEY ARE RETAINED.\n"
	"But Thomas one of the Twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when JESUS came.\n"
	"The other Disciples therefore said to him: We have seen our Lord. But he said to them: unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into his side: I will not believe.\n"
	"And after eight days, again his Disciples were within; and Thomas with them. JESUS cometh the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be to you.\n"
	"Then he saith to Thomas: Put in thy finger hither, and see my hands, and bring hither thy hand, and put it into my side; & be not incredulous but faithful.\n"
	"Thomas answered, & said to him: My Lord, & my God.\n"
	"JESUS saith to him: Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed: Blessed are they that have not seen & have believed.\n"
	"Many other signs also did JESUS in the sight of his Disciples, which are not written in this Book.\n"
	"And these are written, that you may believe that JESUS is CHRIST the Son of God: and that believing, you may have life in his name.";

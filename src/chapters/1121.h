	"under the high Priests Annas and Caiphas: the word of our Lord was made upon John the son of Zacharie, in the desert.\n"
	"And he came into all the country of Jordan, preaching the baptism of penance unto remission of sins; as it is written in the book of the sayings of Esay the Prophet:\n"
	"A voice of one crying in the desert; prepare the way of our Lord, make straight his paths.\n"
	"Every valley shall be filled; and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and crooked things shall become straight; and rough ways, plain:\n"

	"But he said to them: Do nothing more than that which is appointed you.\n"

	"And the people imagining, and all men thinking in their hearts of John, lest perhaps he were Christ:\n"
	"John answered, saying unto all: I indeed baptize you with water, but there shall come a mightier than I, whose latchet of his shoes I am not worthy to loose; he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire:\n"
	"whose fan is in his hand, and he will purge his floor; and will gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.\n"
	"Many other things also exhorting did he evangelize to the people.\n"
	"And Herod the Tetrarch, when he was rebuked of him for Herodias his brother's wife, and for all the evils which Herod did:\n"
	"He added this also above all, and shut up John into prison.\n"
	"And it came to pass when all the people was baptized, JESUS also being baptized and praying, Heaven was opened:\n"
	"And the Holy Ghost descended in corporal shape as a dove upon him: and a voice from Heaven was made: Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.\n"

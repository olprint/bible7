	"Thus saith our Lord God: For that the enemy hath said of you: Aha, the everlasting heights are given to us for an inheritance:\n"
	"therefore prophesy, & say: Thus saith our Lord God: For that you have been desolate, & trodden down round about, & made an inheritance to the rest of the Gentiles, and have ascended upon the lip of the tongue, & the reproach of the people:\n"
	"Therefore ye mountains of Israel hear the word of our Lord God: Thus saith our Lord God to the mountains, and hills, to the torrents, and valleys, & the deserts, and broken walls, and to the cities forsaken, which are spoiled, & scorned of the rest of the Nations round about.\n"
	"Therefore thus saith our Lord God: Because in fire of my zeal I have spoken of the rest of the nations, & of all Idumea, which have given my land to themselves for an inheritance with joy, and with all their heart, and with the mind: and have cast it forth to waste it:\n"
	"therefore prophesy concerning the ground of Israel, and thou shalt say to the mountains, and hills, to the hill-tops, & valleys: Thus saith our Lord God: Behold I have spoken in my zeal, & in my fury because you have sustained the confusion of the Gentiles.\n"
	"Therefore thus saith our Lord God: I have lifted my hand, that the Gentiles which are round about you, they may bear their confusion.\n"
	"But you o mountains of Israel may shoot forth your boughs, and bring forth your fruit to my people of Israel: for he is at hand to come.\n"
	"Because lo I to you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be ploughed, and shall take seed.\n"
	"And I will multiply in you men, and all the house of Israel. And the cities shall be inhabited, & the ruinous places shall be repaired.\n"
	"And I will replenish you with men, and with beasts: and they shall be multiplied, and increase: and I will make you dwell as from the beginning, and will endue you with greater gifts, than you have had from the beginning: and you shall know that I am the Lord.\n"
	"And I will bring men upon you, my people Israel, and they shall possess thee by inheritance: and thou shalt be for an inheritance to them, & thou shalt add no more to be without them.\n"
	"Thus saith our Lord God: For that they say of you: A devourer of men thou art, and one that doest suffocate thy nation.\n"
	"Therefore thou shalt eat men no more, and thy nation thou shalt kill no more, saith our Lord God:\n"
	"neither will I make the confusion of the Gentiles, to be heard in thee any more, and the reproach of the people thou shalt not bear, & thy nation thou shalt lose no more, saith our Lord God.\n"
	"And the word of our Lord was made to me, saying:\n"
	"Son of man, the house of Israel dwelt in their ground, and polluted it in their ways, & in their studies, according to the uncleanness of a menstruous woman was their way made before me.\n"
	"And I have poured out mine indignation upon them for the blood, which they have shed upon the land, & in their idols have polluted it.\n"
	"And I have dispersed them into the Gentiles, & they are scattered into the lands: according to their ways, & their inventions have I judged them\n"
	"And they went in to the Nations, unto which they entered, and have polluted my holy name, when it was said of them: This is the people of the Lord, and out of his land they are come forth.\n"
	"And I have spared my holy name, which the house of Israel polluted among the Gentiles, to which they entered in.\n"
	"Therefore thou shalt say to the house of Israel: Thus saith our Lord God, not for your sake will I do it, o house of Israel, but for my holy name which you have polluted in the Nations to which you entered.\n"
	"And I will sanctify my great name, that is polluted among the Gentiles, which you have polluted in the midst of them: that the Gentiles may know that I am the Lord, saith our Lord of hosts, when I shall be sanctified in you before them.\n"
	"For I will take you out of the Gentiles, & will gather you together out of all the lands, & will bring you into your land.\n"
	"And I will pour out upon you clean water, and you shall be cleansed from all your contaminations, and from all your idols will I cleanse you.\n"
	"And I will give you a new heart, and will put a new spirit in the midst of you: and will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and will give you a fleshy heart.\n"
	"And I will put my spirit in the midst of you: and I will make that you walk in my precepts, and keep my judgements, and do them.\n"
	"And you shall dwell in the land: which I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.\n"
	"And I will save you from all your contaminations: and I will call for corn, and will multiply it, and will not put famine upon you.\n"
	"And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the offsprings of the field, that you bear no more the reproach of famine among the Gentiles.\n"
	"And you shall remember your most wicked ways, & your studies not good: & your iniquities, & your wicked deeds shall displease you.\n"
	"Not for you will I do it, saith our Lord God, be it known to you: be ye confounded, & ashamed upon your ways, o house of Israel.\n"
	"Thus saith our Lord God: In the day that I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, & shall make the cities to be inhabited, & shall repair the ruinous places.\n"
	"& the desert land shall be tilled, which once was desolate in the eyes of every wayfaring man,\n"
	"they shall say: This land untilled is become as a garden of pleasure: and the desert cities, and destitute and undermined, have sitten fenced.\n"
	"And the Nations whatsoever shall be left round about you, shall know that I^ the Lord have builded the destroyed things, & planted the untilled places, that I^ the Lord have spoken, and done it.\n"
	"Thus saith our Lord God: As yet in this shall the house of Israel find me, that I will do for them: I will multiply them as a flock of men,\n"
	"as a holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in the solemnities thereof: So shall the desert cities be full of flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the Lord.";

const char* chap786 = "The vision of Isaie the son of Amos, which he saw concerning Juda and Jerusalem in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda.\n"
	"Hear ye heavens, & give ear o earth, because our Lord hath spoken. I have brought up children, and exalted them: but they have despised me.\n"
	"The oxe hath known his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood.\n"
	"Woe to the sinful nation, the people laden with grievous iniquity, the wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken our Lord, they have blasphemed the holy one of Israel, they are revolted backwards.\n"
	"For what shall I strike you any more, which add prevarication? Every head is sick, & every heart in heaviness.\n"
	"From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no health therein: wound, and wail, and swelling stroke: it is not bound up, nor cured with medicine, nor mollified with oil.\n"
	"Your land is desolate, your cities burnt with fire: your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be made desolate as in the spoil of enemies.\n"
	"And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a vineyard, and as a cottage in a place of cucumbers, and as a city that is wasted.\n"
	"Unless the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom, and we should be like to Gomorrha.\n"
	"Hear the word of our Lord ye Princes of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God ye people of Gomorrha.\n"
	"To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims, saith our Lord? I am full, the holocaust of rams, and the fat of fatlings, and the blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats I have not desired.\n"
	"When you should have come before my sight, who sought for these things at your hands, that you should walk in my courts?\n"
	"Offer sacrifice no more in vain: incense is abomination to me. The New moon, and the Sabbath, and other festivities I will not abide, your assemblies are wicked.\n"
	"My soul hateth your Calends, and your solemnities: they are become tedious to me, I have laboured in sustaining.\n"
	"And when you shall stretch forth your hands, I will turn away mine eyes from you: & when you shall multiply prayer, I will not hear: for your hands are full of blood.\n"
	"Wash you, be clean, take away the evil of your cogitations from mine eyes: cease to do perversely,\n"
	"Learn to do good: seek judgement, succour the oppressed, judge for the pupil, defend the widow.\n"
	"And come, and accuse me, saith our Lord: if your sins shall be as scarlet, they shall be made white as snow: and if they be red as vermilion, they shall be white as wool.\n"
	"If you be willing, and will hear me, you shall eat the good things of the earth.\n"
	"But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath: the sword shall devour you, because the mouth of our Lord hath spoken.\n"
	"How is the faithful city full of judgement become an harlot? Justice hath dwelled in it, but now mankillers.\n"
	"Thy silver is turned into dross: thy wine is mingled with water.\n"
	"Thy princes are unfaithful, companions of thieves: all love gifts, follow rewards. They judge not for the pupil: and the widow's cause goeth not in to them.\n"
	"For this cause saith our Lord the God of hosts the mighty one of Israel: Alas! I will comfort myself upon mine adversaries: and will be revenged of mine enemies.\n"
	"And I will turn mine hand to thee, and I will boil out thy dross till it be pure, & will take away all thy tin.\n"
	"And I will restore thy judges as they have been before, and thy counsellers as of old. After these things thou shalt be called the just, a faithful city.\n"
	"Sion shall be redeemed in judgement, and they shall bring her back in justice.\n"
	"And he shall destroy the wicked and the sinners together: and they that have forsaken our Lord, shall be consumed.\n"
	"For they shall be confounded for the idols, to which they have sacrificed: and you shall be ashamed of the gardens, which you chose.\n"
	"When you shall be as an oak the leaves falling off, and as a garden without water.\n"
	"And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow, and your work as a spark: and both shall be set on fire together, and there shall be none to quench it.";

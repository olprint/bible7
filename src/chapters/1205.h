	"For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs.\n"
	"Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.\n"
	"Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own Lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.\n"
	"For one judgeth between day and day; and another judgeth every day: let every one abound in his own sense.\n"
	"He that respecteth the day, respecteth to our Lord. And he that eateth, eateth to our Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to our Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to God.\n"
	"For none of us liveth to himself: and no man dieth to himself.\n"
	"For whether we live, we live to our Lord; or whether we die, we die to our Lord. Therefore whether we live, or whether we die, we are our Lord's.\n"
	"For to this end Christ died and rose again; that he may have dominion both of the dead and of the living.\n"

	"Therefore the things that are of peace let us pursue: and the things that are of edifying one toward another let us keep.\n"
	"Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is ill for the man that eateth by giving offence.\n"
	"It is good not to eat flesh, and not to drink wine, nor that wherein thy brother is offended, or scandalized, or weakened.\n"
	"Hast thou faith? have it with thyself before God. Blessed is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.\n"
	"But he that discerneth, if he eat, is damned; because not of faith. For all that is not of faith, is sin.";

const char* chap1306 = "My little children, these things I write to you, that you sin not. But and if any man shall sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, JESUS Christ the just:\n"
	"and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the whole world's.\n"
	"And in this we know that we have known him, if we observe his commandments.\n"
	"He that saith he knoweth him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him:\n"
	"But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of God is perfited: in this we know that we be in him.\n"
	"He that saith he abideth in him, ought even as he walked, himself also to walk.\n"
	"My dearest, I write not a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard.\n"
	"Again a new commandment write I to you, which thing is true both in him and in you: because the darkness is passed, and the true light now shineth.\n"
	"He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in the darkness even until now.\n"
	"He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and scandal is not in him.\n"
	"But he that hateth his brother, is in the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.\n"
	"I write unto you little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name.\n"
	"I write unto you fathers, because you have known him which is from the beginning. I write unto you young men, because you have overcome the wicked one.\n"
	"I write to you infants, because you have known the Father. I write unto you young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.\n"
	"Love not the world, nor those things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.\n"
	"because all that is in the world, is the concupiscence of the flesh, and the concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not of the Father, but is of the world.\n"
	"And the world passeth and the concupiscence thereof. But he that doeth the will of God, abideth for ever.\n"
	"Little children, it is the last hour, & as you have heard, that Antichrist cometh: now there are become many Antichrists, whereby we know, that it is the last hour.\n"
	"They went out from us; but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would surely have remained with us: but that they may be manifest that they are not all of us.\n"
	"But you have the unction from the Holy one, and know all things.\n"
	"I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but as to them that know it: and that no lie is of the truth.\n"
	"Who is a liar, but he which denieth that JESUS is Christ? This is Antichrist which denieth the Father and the Son.\n"
	"Every one that denieth the Son, neither hath he the Father. He that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also.\n"
	"You, that which you have heard from the beginning, let it abide in you. If that abide in you which you have heard from the beginning, you also shall abide in the Son & the Father.\n"
	"And this is the promise which he promised us, life everlasting.\n"
	"These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce you.\n"
	"And you, the unction which you have received from him, let it abide in you. And you have no need that any man teach you: but as his unction teacheth you of all things, and it is true, and it is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide in him.\n"
	"And now little children abide in him: that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be confounded of him in his coming.\n"
	"If you know that he is just, know ye that every one also which doeth justice, is born of him.";

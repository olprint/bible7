	"And many nations shall hasten, & shall say: Come, let us go up to the mountain of our Lord, & to the house of the God of Jacob: & he will teach us of his ways, & we shall go in his paths: because out of Sion shall the law go forth, & the word of our Lord out of Jerusalem.\n"
	"And he shall judge between many peoples, and he shall rebuke strong nations unto a far off: and they shall cut their swords into coulters, and their spears into spades: nation shall not take sword against nation: and they shall no more learn to make battle.\n"
	"And every man shall sit under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and there shall be none to make them afraid: because the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.\n"
	"Because all peoples will walk every one in the name of his god: but we shall walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.\n"

	"And now many nations are gathered together upon thee, which say: Let her be stoned: and let our eye look upon Sion.\n"
	"But they have not known the cogitations of our Lord, and have not understood his counsel: because he hath gathered them together as the hay of the floor.\n"

	"How long will ye speak vaunting words? Understand ye first, and so let us speak.\n"
	"Why are we reputed as beasts, and accounted vile before you?\n"
	"Which destroyest thy soul in thy fury, shall the earth be forsaken for thee, and shall rocks be transported out of their place?\n"
	"Shall not the light of the impious be extinguished, and the flame of his fire not shine?\n"
	"The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and the candle that is over him, shall be extinguished.\n"
	"The steps of his power shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down headlong.\n"
	"For he hath thrust his feet into a net, and walketh in the mashes thereof.\n"
	"The sole of his foot shall be held in a snare, and thirst shall burn against him.\n"
	"His gin is hid in the earth, and his spring upon the path.\n"
	"Fears shall terrify him on every side, and his feet shall entangle him.\n"
	"Let his strength be extenuated with famine, and let hunger invade his ribs.\n"
	"Let it devour the beauty of his skin, let death the first-born consume his arms.\n"
	"Let his confidence be plucked away out of his tabernacle, and let destruction as a king tread upon him.\n"
	"Let the companions of him, that is not, dwell in his tabernacle, let brimstone be sprinkled in his tent.\n"
	"Let his roots be dried downward, and his harvest destroyed upward.\n"
	"Let the memory of him perish from the earth, and let not his name be renowned in the streets.\n"
	"He shall expel him out of light into darkness, and shall transport him out of the world.\n"
	"His seed shall not be, nor his progeny in his people, nor any remnants in his countries.\n"
	"In his day^ the last shall be astonished, and horror shall invade the first.\n"
	"These are then the tabernacles of the wicked man, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.";

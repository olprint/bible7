	"For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy greatness: and if we sin not, we know that we are counted with thee.\n"
	"For to know thee, is absolute justice: and to know justice, and thy power, is the root of immortality.\n"
	"For men's invention of evil art hath not brought us into error, nor the shadow of a picture^ being a labour without fruit, a shape graven by diverse colours,\n"
	"the sight whereof giveth concupiscence to the senseless, and he loveth the shape without life of a dead image.\n"
	"The lovers of evils are worthy to have their hope in such things, both they that make them, and that love, and that worship them.\n"
	"Yea and the potter pressing soft earth, with labour fashioneth every vessel to our uses, and of the same clay maketh the vessels that are clean to use, and in like manner them, that are contrary to these: but what the use of these vessels is, the potter is judge.\n"
	"And with vain labour he fashioneth a God of the same clay: he which a little before was made of earth, and a little after returneth back whence he was taken, being exacted the debt of the life which he had.\n"
	"But his care is, not because he shall labour, nor because he hath a short life, but he contendeth with gold-smiths and silver-smiths: yea and he imitateth the copper-smiths, and counteth it a glory, because he maketh vain things.\n"
	"For his heart is ashes, and his hope vain earth, and his life viler than clay:\n"
	"because he was ignorant who made him, and who inspired into him the soul which worketh, & who breathed into him the vital spirit.\n"
	"Yea and they esteemed our life to be a pastime, and the conversation of life made for a gain, & that we must get every way even of evil.\n"

	"For all the unwise and unhappy above measure of the soul, proud are the enemies of thy people, and rule over them:\n"
	"because they have esteemed all the idols of the nations for gods, which neither have use of eyes to see, nor nostrils to take breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of the hands to handle, yea and their feet are slow to walk.\n"
	"For a man made them: and he that borrowed breath, the same fashioned them. For no man can make God like to himself.\n"
	"For whereas himself is mortal, he maketh a dead thing with his wicked hands. For he is better than they, whom he worshippeth, because he indeed lived, though he were mortal, but they never.\n"
	"But they worship also most miserable beasts: for the senseless things compared to these, are worse than they.\n"
	"Yea neither by sight can any man see good of these beasts, But they have fled from the praise of God, and from his blessing.";

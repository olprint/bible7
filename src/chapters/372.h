	"After which things he gathered together all the ancients of Israel, and all the Princes of the tribes, and the heads of families, of the children of Israel into Jerusalem, to bring the Ark of the covenant of our Lord from the City of David, which is Sion.\n"
	"There came therefore unto the king all the men of Israel in the solemn day of the seventh month.\n"
	"And when all the ancients of Israel were come, the Levites carried the Ark,\n"
	"and brought it in, and all the furniture of the tabernacle. Moreover the Priests with the Levites did carry the vessels of the Sanctuary, which were in the tabernacle.\n"
	"And king Salomon, and all the assembly of Israel, and all that were gathered before the Ark, immolated rams, and oxen without any number: for so great was the multitude of victims.\n"
	"And the Priests brought in the Ark of the covenant of our Lord into his place, that is, to the oracle of the temple, into Sancta Sanctorum under the wings of the cherubs:\n"
	"so that the cherubs spread their wings over the place wherein the Ark was set, and covered the Ark itself with his bars.\n"
	"And the heads of the bars, wherewith the Ark was carried, because they were a little longer, appeared before the oracle: but if a man had been a little outward, he could not see them. The Ark therefore was there until this present day.\n"
	"And there was nothing in the Ark, but the two tables, which Moyses had put in Horeb, when our Lord gave the law to the children of Israel coming out of Aegypt.\n"
	"And the Priests being gone out of the Sanctuary (for all the Priests that could be found there, were sanctified, neither as yet at that time were the courses & order of the ministries divided among them)\n"
	"as well the Levites as the singing men, that is, both they which were under Asaph, and they which were under Heman, and they which were under Idithun, their sons, and brethren revested with fine linen cloths, sounding cymbals, and psalteries, and harps, standing at the East side of the Altar, and with them Priests an hundred twenty, sounding with trumpets.\n"
	"Therefore all sounding together, both with trumpets, and voice, and cymbals, and organs, and with diverse kind of musical instruments, and lifting up their voice on high: the sound was heard far off, so that when they began to praise our Lord, and to say: Confess to our Lord, because he is good, because his mercy is for ever: the house of God was filled with a cloud,\n"
	"that the Priests could not stand and minister for the darkness. For the glory of our Lord had filled the house of God.";

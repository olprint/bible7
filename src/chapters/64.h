const char* chap64 = "And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying:\n"
	"Speak to the children of Israel: Let them return and camp over against Phihahiroth which is between Magdal and the sea against Beelsephon: in the sight thereof you shall camp upon the sea.\n"
	"And Pharao will say concerning the children of Israel: They are straightened in the land, the desert hath shut them in.\n"
	"And I will indurate his heart, and he will pursue you: and I will be glorified in Pharao, and in all his army: and the Aegyptians shall know that I am the Lord. And they did so.\n"
	"And it was told the king of Aegyptians that the people was fled: and the heart of Pharao and of his servants was changed toward the people, & they said: What meant we to do, that we dismissed Israel from serving us?\n"
	"Therefore he made ready his chariot, and took all his people with him.\n"
	"And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots that were in Aegypt, and Captains of the whole army.\n"
	"And our Lord hardened Pharao's heart the king of Aegypt, & he pursued the children of Israel: but they went forth in a mighty hand.\n"
	"And when the Aegyptians pursued their steps going before, they found them encamped at the sea side: all Pharao's horse and chariots, & the whole army were in Phihahiroth against Beelsephon.\n"
	"And when Pharao approached, the children of Israel lifting up their eyes, saw the Aegyptians behind them: and they feared exceedingly, and cried to our Lord.\n"
	"and said to Moyses: Perhaps there were no graves in Aegypt, therefore thou hast taken us thence to die in the wilderness: why wouldst thou do this, in bringing us out of Aegypt?\n"
	"Is not this the word that we spake to thee in Aegypt, saying: Depart from us, that we may serve the Aegyptians? For it was much better to serve them, than to die in the wilderness.\n"
	"And Moyses said to the people: Fear not; stand, and see the great wonders of our Lord that he will do this day: for the Aegyptians, whom now you see, you shall no more see for ever.\n"
	"Our Lord will fight for you and you shall hold your peace.\n"
	"And our Lord said to Moyses: Why cryest thou to me? Speak to the children of Israel that they go forward.\n"
	"But thou lift up thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand upon the sea, and divide it: that the children of Israel may go in the midst of the sea by dry ground.\n"
	"And I will indurate the heart of the Aegyptians to pursue you: and I will be glorified in Pharao, and in all his host, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen.\n"
	"And the Aegyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I shall be glorified in Pharao, and in his chariots and in his horsemen.\n"
	"And the Angel of God that went before the camp of Israel, removing himself, went behind them: & together with him the pillar of the cloud, leaving the forward,\n"
	"stood behind, between the Aegyptian's camp & the camp of Israel: & it was a dark cloud, & lightening the night, so that they could not come to each other the whole night time.\n"
	"And when Moyses had stretched forth his hand upon the sea, our Lord took it away, a vehement and burning wind blowing all the night, and turned it into dry ground: and the water was divided.\n"
	"And the children of Israel went through the midst of the dry sea: for the water was as it were a wall on their right hand and their left.\n"
	"And the Aegyptians pursuing went in after them, and all Pharao's horses, his chariots and horsemen through the midst of the sea.\n"
	"And now the morning watch was come, and behold our Lord looking upon the Aegyptian's camp through the pillar of fire and the cloud, slew their army:\n"
	"and overthrew the wheels of the chariots, and they were borne into the depth. The Aegyptians therefore said: Let us fly from Israel: for the Lord fighteth for them against us.\n"
	"And our Lord said to Moyses: Stretch forth thy hand upon the sea, that the waters may return to the Aegyptians upon their chariots and horsemen.\n"
	"And when Moyses had stretched forth his hand against the sea, it returned in the first break of day to the former place: and the Aegyptians flying away, the waters came upon them, and our Lord enwrapt them in the midst of the waves.\n"
	"And the waters returned, and overwhelmed the chariots & the horsemen of all Pharao's army, who following were entered into the sea, neither did there so much as one of them remain.\n"
	"But the children of Israel marched through the midst of the dry sea, and the waters were unto them as instead of a wall on the right hand and on the left:\n"
	"& our Lord delivered Israel in that day out of the hand of the Aegyptians.\n"
	"And they saw the Aegyptians dead upon the sea shore, & the mighty hand that our Lord had exercised against them: & the people feared our Lord, and they believed our Lord, and Moyses his servant.";

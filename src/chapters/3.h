	"To whom the woman answered: Of the fruit of the trees that are in Paradise we do eat:\n"
	"but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of Paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat: and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.\n"
	"And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death.\n"
	"For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\n"
	"The woman therefore saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delectable to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, & did eat, & gave to her husband, who did eat.\n"
	"And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sowed together leaves of a fig tree, and made themselves aprons.\n"

	"And our Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou?\n"
	"Who said: I heard thy voice in Paradise: and I feared, because I was naked, and I hid me.\n"
	"To whom he said: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?\n"
	"And Adam said: The woman which thou gavest me to be my fellow-companion, gave me of the tree, & I did eat.\n"
	"And our Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? Who answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.\n"
	"And our Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, accursed art thou among all cattle, and beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, & earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.\n"
	"I will put enmity between thee & the woman, & thy seed and the seed of her: she shall bruise thy head in pieces, and thou shalt lie in wait of her heel.\n"
	"To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy travails and thy child-bearings: in travail shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband's power, and he shall have dominion over thee.\n"
	"And to Adam he said: Because thou hast heard the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree wherefore I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work: with much toiling shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.\n"
	"Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth.\n"

	"Our Lord God also made for Adam and his wife garments of skins, and clothed them:\n"
	"And said: Lo Adam is become as it were one of us, knowing good & evil: now therefore lest perhaps he reach forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.\n"
	"And our Lord God sent him out of the Paradise of pleasure, to work the earth of which he was taken.\n"

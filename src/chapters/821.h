const char* chap821 = "And it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Ezechias, Sennacherib king of the Assyrians came up against all the fenced cities of Juda, and took them.\n"
	"And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabsaces from Lachis to Jerusalem, to king Ezechias with a great army, and he stood by the water conduit of the upper pool in the way of the fuller's field.\n"
	"And there came out to him Eliacim the son of Helcias, who was over the house, and Sobna the scribe, and Joahe the son of Asaph the commenter.\n"
	"And Rabsaces said to them: Tell Ezechias: Thus saith the great king, the king of the Assyrians: What is this confidence, whereupon thou dost trust?\n"
	"or by what counsel or force art thou disposed to rebel? Upon whom hast thou confidence, that thou art revolted from me?\n"
	"Lo thou dost trust upon this broken staff of reed, upon Aegypt: upon which if a man lean, it will enter into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharao the king of Aegypt to all that trust in him.\n"
	"But if thou wilt answer me: We trust in our Lord God: is it not he whose excelses and altars Ezechias hath taken away, and he said to Juda and Jerusalem: Before this altar shall you adore?\n"
	"And now deliver thyself to my lord the king of the Assyrians, and I will give thee two thousand horses, neither shall thou be able of thyself to give riders for them.\n"
	"And how wilt thou abide the face of the judge of one place, of the lesser servants of my lord? But if thou trust in Aegypt, in chariots and in horsemen:\n"
	"and now am I come up without the Lord unto this land to destroy it? The Lord saith to me: Go up against this land, and destroy it.\n"
	"And Eliacim, and Sobna, and Joahe said to Rabsaces: Speak to thy servants in the Syrian tongue: for we understand it: speak not to us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people, that is upon the wall.\n"
	"And Rabsaces said to them: Why, did my lord send me to thy lord and to thee, to speak all these words; and not rather to the men, that sit on the wall; that they may eat their own dung, and drink the urine of their feet with you?\n"
	"And Rabsaces stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said: Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyrians.\n"
	"Thus saith the king: Let not Ezechias seduce you, for he shall not be able to deliver you.\n"
	"And let not Ezechias give you confidence upon the Lord, saying: Our Lord delivering will deliver us, this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyrians.\n"
	"Hear not Ezechias: for thus saith the king of Assyrians, do a blessing with me, and come forth to me, and eat ye every man of his own vineyard, and every man of his own figtree, and drink ye every man the water of his own cistern,\n"
	"till I come and take you away to a land, that is as your own, a land of corn and of wine, a land of bread and vineyards.\n"
	"Neither let Ezechias trouble you, saying: Our Lord will deliver us. Why, have the gods of the nations delivered every one their land out of the hand of the king of Assyrians?\n"
	"Where is the god of Emath, and Arphad? Where is the god of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?\n"
	"Who is there of all the gods of these lands, which hath delivered their land out of my hand, that the Lord can deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?\n"
	"And they held their peace, and answered him not a word. For the king had commanded, saying: Answer him not.\n"
	"And Eliacim the son of Helcias, that was over the house, and Sobna the scribe, and Joahe the son of Asaph the commenter, went in to Ezechias their garments rent, and told him the words of Rabsaces.";

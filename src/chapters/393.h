	"He built Ailath, & restored it to the dominion of Juda, after that the king slept with his fathers.\n"
	"Sixteen years old was Ozias when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem, the name of his mother was Jechelia of Jerusalem.\n"
	"And he did that which was right in the eyes of our Lord, according to all things, which Amasias his father had done.\n"
	"And he sought our Lord in the days of Zacharias that understood and saw God: and when he sought our Lord, he directed him in all things.\n"
	"Moreover he went forth, and fought against the Philisthiims, and destroyed the wall of Geth, and the wall of Iabinia, and the wall of Azotus: he built also towns in Azotus, and among the Philisthiims.\n"
	"And God did help him against the Philisthiims, and against the Arabians, that dwelt in Gurbaal, & against the Ammonites.\n"
	"And the Ammonites gave gifts to Ozias: and his name was renowned unto the entrance of Aegypt for his often victories.\n"
	"And Ozias built towers in Jerusalem over the gate of the corner, and over the gate of the valley, and the rest, in the same side of the wall, and strengthened them.\n"
	"He built towers also in the wilderness, and digged many cisterns, because he had much cattle as well in the champion, as in the vastity of the desert: he had also vineyards and dressers of vines in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he was a man given to husbandry.\n"
	"And the host of his warriors, which went forth to battles, was under the hand of Jehiel the scribe, and Maasias the doctor, and under the hand of Hananias, who was of the king's dukes.\n"
	"And all the number of the Princes by families of valiant men, was two thousand six hundred.\n"
	"And under them all the host of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred: which were apt to battles, and fought for the king against the adversaries.\n"
	"Ozias also prepared for them, that is to say, for all the army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and slings to cast stones.\n"
	"And he made in Jerusalem engines of diverse kind, which he placed in the towers, and in the corners of the walls, to shoot arrows, & great stones: and his name went forth far, for that our Lord did aid him, and had strengthened him.\n"
	"But when he was strengthened, his heart was elevated to his destruction, and he neglected our Lord his God: and entering into the temple of our Lord, he would burn incense upon the altar of incense.\n"
	"And incontinent Azarias the Priest going in after him, and with him the Priests of our Lord eighty, most valiant men,\n"
	"they resisted the king, and said: It is not thy office Ozias, to burn incense to our Lord, but of the Priests, that is, of the children of Aaron, which are consecrated to this kind of ministry: go out of the Sanctuary, contemn not: because this thing shall not be reputed to thee for glory of our Lord God.\n"
	"And Ozias being angry, and holding in his hand the censer to burn incense, threatened the Priests. And forthwith there rose a leprosy in his forehead before the Priests, in the house of our Lord upon the altar of incense.\n"
	"And when Azarias the high Priest had beheld him, and all the rest of the Priests, they saw the leprosy in his forehead, and in haste they thrust him out. Yea and himself being sore afraid, made haste to go out, because he felt by and by the plague of our Lord.\n"
	"Ozias therefore the king was a leper until the day of his death, and he dwelt in a house apart full of the leprosy, for the which he had been cast out of the house of our Lord. Moreover Joathan his son governed the king's house, and judged the people of the land.\n"
	"But the rest of the words of Ozias the first and the last wrote Isaias the son of Amos, the Prophet.\n"
	"And Ozias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the kings' sepulchres' field, because he was a leper: and Joathan his son reigned for him.";

const char* chap269 = "Therefore after these things David consulted our Lord, saying: Shall I go up into one of the cities of Juda? And our Lord said to him: Go up, And David said: Whither shall I go up? And he answered him: Into Hebron.\n"
	"David therefore went up, and his two wives, Achinoam the Jezrahelite, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel:\n"
	"yea and the men also that were with him, David brought every one with his household: and they abode in the towns of Hebron.\n"
	"And the men of Juda came, and anointed David there, to reign over the house of Juda. And it was told David, that the men of Jabes Galaad had buried Saul.\n"
	"David therefore sent messengers unto the men of Jabes Galaad, and said unto them: Blessed be you to our Lord, which have done this mercy with your lord Saul, and have buried him.\n"
	"And now our Lord certes will render you mercy and truth: but I also will requite you the good turn, for that you have done this thing.\n"
	"Let your hands be strengthened, and be ye stout men: for although your lord Saul be dead, yet the house of Juda hath anointed me to be their king.\n"
	"But Abner the son of Ner Prince of Saul's army, took Isboseth the son of Saul, and led him about through the camp,\n"
	"and ordained him king over Galaad, & over Gessuri, & over Jezrahel, & over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.\n"
	"Forty years old was Isboseth the son of Saul when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years: and only the house of Juda followed David.\n"
	"And the number of the days, that David abode, reigning in Hebron over the house of Juda, was seven years and six months.\n"
	"And Abner the son of Ner went forth, and the servants of Isboseth the son of Saul, out of the camp into Gabaon.\n"
	"Moreover Joab the son of Sarvia, and the servants of David went forth, and met them beside the people of Gabaon, and when they were come together into one place, they sat one over-against another: these on the one side of the pool, and they on the other.\n"
	"And Abner said to Joab: Let the young men rise, and play before us. And Joab answered: Let them rise.\n"
	"There rose therefore and passed twelve in number, of Benjamin, of Isboseth's part the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.\n"
	"And every one taking the head of his mate, sticked his sword into the side of his adversary, and they fell together: and the name of the place was called: The field of the valiants, in Gabaon.\n"
	"And there rose a very sore battle in that day: & Abner was put to flight, and the men of Israel, by the servants of David.\n"
	"And there were there the three sons of Sarvia, Joab, and Abisai, & Asael: moreover Asael was a most swift runner, as it were one of the roes, that abide in the woods.\n"
	"And Asael pursued Abner, and declined not to the right hand nor to the left omitting to pursue Abner.\n"
	"Abner therefore looked back behind him, and said: Art thou Asael? Who answered: I am.\n"
	"And Abner said to him: Go to the right hand, or to the left, and apprehend one of the young men, and take to thee his spoils. But Asael would not leave but urged him.\n"
	"And again Abner said to Asael: Retire, and do not follow me, lest I be compelled to stick thee to the ground, and I shall not be able to lift up my face to Joab thy brother.\n"
	"Who contemned to hear, and would not go aside: Abner therefore struck him with his spear turned back in the privy parts, and thrust him through, and he died in the same place: and all that passed by that place, wherein Asael fell & died, did stay.\n"
	"But whiles Joab and Abisai pursued Abner flying, the sun went down: & they came as far as the hill of the water conduit, that is over-against the valley the way of the desert in Gabaon.\n"
	"And the children of Benjamin were assembled together to Abner: and being gathered in a plump into one troop, they stood in the top of one hill.\n"
	"And Abner cried out to Joab, and said: Shall thy sword rage unto utter destruction? Knowest thou not that desperation is dangerous? How long deferrest thou to say to the people, that they leave to pursue their brethren?\n"
	"And Joab said: Our Lord liveth, if thou hadst spoken, in the morning had the people retired from pursuing their brethren.\n"
	"Joab therefore sounded the trumpet, and all the army stood, neither did they pursue Israel any further, nor enter into fight.\n"
	"And Abner and his men went through the champion country, all that night: and they passed Jordan, and having viewed all Beth-horon, came to the camp.\n"
	"Moreover Joab returning, after he had left Abner, assembled all the people: and there wanted of David's servants nineteen men, beside Asael.\n"
	"But the servants of David struck of Benjamin, and of the men that were with Abner, three hundred three score, who also died.\n"
	"And they took Asael, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father in Bethlehem: and Joab, and the men that were with him, walked all the night, and in the very twilight they came into Hebron.";

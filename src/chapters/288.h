	"The king therefore calling the Gabaonites, said to them. (Moreover the Gabaonites were not of the children of Israel, but the relics of the Amorrheites: For the children of Israel had sworn to them, and Saul would strike them of zeal, as it were for the children of Israel & Juda.)\n"
	"David therefore said to the Gabaonites: What shall I do for you? And what shall be the expiation for you, that you may bless the inheritance of our Lord?\n"
	"And the Gabaonites said to him: We have no question upon silver and gold, but against Saul, and against his house: neither will we that a man be slain of Israel. To whom the king said: What will you then that I do for you?\n"
	"Who said to the king? The man, that hath wasted us and oppressed us unjustly, we must so destroy, that there be not so much as one left of his stock in all the coasts of Israel.\n"
	"Let there be given us seven men of his children, that we may crucify them to our Lord in Gabaa of Saul, once the chosen of our Lord. And the king said: I will give them.\n"
	"And the king spared Miphiboseth the son of Jonathas the son of Saul, for the oath of our Lord, that had been between David, and between Jonathas the son of Saul.\n"
	"The king therefore took the two sons of Respha the daughter of Aia, whom she bare to Saul, Armoni, and Miphiboseth: and the five sons of Michol the daughter of Saul, which she bare to Hadriel the son of Berzellai, that was of Molathi,\n"
	"and gave them into the hands of the Gabaonites: who crucified them on a hill before our Lord: and these seven died together in the first days of harvest, when the reaping of barley began.\n"
	"And Respha the daughter of Aia taking a hair-cloth, spread it under her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest, till water dropped upon them from heaven: and she suffered not the birds to tear them by day, nor the beasts by night.\n"
	"And the things were told David, which Respha had done, the daughter of Aia, the concubine of Saul.\n"
	"And David went, and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathas his son from the men of Jabes Galaad, who had stolen them out of the street of Bethsan, in the which the Philisthiims hanged them when they had killed Saul in Gelboe.\n"
	"And he carried thence the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathas his son: and gathering the bones of them that were crucified,\n"
	"they buried them with the bones of Saul and of Jonathas his son in the Land of Benjamin, in the side, in the sepulchre of Cis his father: and they did all things that the king had commanded, and God was made propitious again to the land after these things.\n"
	"And there was a battle made again of the Philistians against Israel, and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philisthiims. And David fainting,\n"
	"Jesbibenob, which was of the kindred of Arapha, the iron of whose spear weighed three hundred ounces, & he was girded with a new sword, assayed to strike David.\n"
	"And Abisai the son of Sarvia rescued him, and striking the Philistian killed him. Then sware David's men, saying: Thou shalt no more go forth with us into battle, lest thou put out the lamp of Israel.\n"
	"There was also a second battle in Gob against the Philistians: then struck Sobochai of Husathi, Saph of the stock of Arapha of the kindred of the giants.\n"
	"There was also a third battle in Gob against the Philistians, in the which Adeodatus the son of the Forest a broiderer the Bethlehemite struck Goliath the Getheite, the shaft of whose spear was as it were a weaver's beam.\n"
	"The fourth battle was in Geth: in the which was a tall man, that had six fingers and six toes on each hand and foot, that is four and twenty, and he was of the race of Arapha.\n"
	"And he blasphemed Israel: and Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of David struck him.\n"
	"These four were born of Arapha in Geth, and they fell by the hand of David, and of his servants.";

const char* chap1154 = "JESUS therefore six days before the Pasch^ came to Bethania, where Lazarus was, that had been dead, whom JESUS raised.\n"
	"And they made him a supper there: and Martha ministered, but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.\n"
	"Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, precious, and anointed the feet of JESUS, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled of the odour of the ointment.\n"
	"One therefore of his Disciples, Judas Iscariote, he that was to betray him, said:\n"
	"Why was not this ointment sold for three-hundred pence, and given to the poor?\n"
	"And he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put in.\n"
	"JESUS therefore said: Let her alone that she may keep it for the day of my burial.\n"
	"For the poor you have always with you; but me you shall not have always.\n"
	"A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not for JESUS only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he raised from the dead.\n"
	"But the chief Priests devised for to kill Lazarus also:\n"
	"because many for him of the Jews went away, and believed in JESUS.\n"
	"And on the morrow a great multitude that was come to the festival day, when they had heard that JESUS cometh to Jerusalem,\n"
	"they took the boughs of palms, and went forth to meet him, & cried: Hosanna, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of our Lord, the King of Israel.\n"
	"And JESUS found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written:\n"
	"Fear not daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh sitting upon an ass's colt.\n"
	"These things his Disciples did not know at the first: but when JESUS was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written of him, and these things they did to him.\n"
	"The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead.\n"
	"For therefore also the multitude came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this sign.\n"
	"The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? Behold the whole world is gone after him.\n"
	"And there were certain Gentiles of them that came up to adore in the festival day.\n"
	"These therefore came to Philippe who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we are desirous to see JESUS.\n"
	"Philippe cometh and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew & Philippe told JESUS.\n"
	"But JESUS answered them, saying: The hour is come, that the Son of man shall be glorified.\n"
	"Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground, die: itself remaineth alone. but if it die, it bringeth much fruit.\n"
	"He that loveth his life shall lose it: and he that hateth his life in this world, doth keep it to life everlasting.\n"
	"If any man minister to me, let him follow me: and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, my Father will honour him.\n"
	"Now my soul is troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But therefore came I into this hour.\n"
	"Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from Heaven: Both I have glorified it, and again I will glorify it.\n"
	"The multitude therefore that stood and had heard, said that it thundered. Others said, An Angel spake to him.\n"
	"JESUS answered, and said: This voice came not for me, but for your sake.\n"
	"Now is the judgement of the world: now the Prince of this world shall be cast forth.\n"
	"And I, if I be exalted from the earth, will draw all things to myself.\n"
	"(And this he said, signifying what death he should die.)\n"
	"The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that CHRIST abideth for ever; and how sayest thou: The Son of man must be exalted? Who is this Son of man?\n"
	"JESUS therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whiles you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.\n"
	"Whiles you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things JESUS spake and he went away, and hid himself from them.\n"
	"And whereas he had done so many signs before them, they believed not in him:\n"
	"that the saying of Esay the Prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who hath believed the hearing of us? and the arm of our Lord to whom hath it been revealed?\n"
	"Therefore they could not believe, because Esay said again:\n"
	"He hath blinded their eyes, and indurated their heart: that they may not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I heal them.\n"
	"These things said Esaie, when he saw his glory, & spake of him.\n"
	"But yet of the Princes also many believed in him: but for the Pharisees they did not confess, that they might not be cast out of the Synagogue.\n"
	"For they loved the glory of men more, than the glory of God.\n"
	"But JESUS cried, and said: He that believeth in me, doth not believe in me, but in him that sent me.\n"
	"And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.\n"
	"I a light am come into this world: that every one which believeth in me, may not remain in the darkness.\n"
	"And if any man hear my words, and keep them not: I do not judge him. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.\n"
	"He that despiseth me, & receiveth not my words, hath that judgeth him. the word that I have spoken, that shall judge him in the last day.\n"
	"Because^ of myself I have not spoken, but the Father that sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.\n"
	"And I know that his commandment is life everlasting. The things therefore that I speak: as the Father said to me, so do I speak.";

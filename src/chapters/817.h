const char* chap817 = "Behold the king shall reign in justice, & the princes shall rule in judgement.\n"
	"And a man shall be as he that is hid from the wind, and hideth himself from a tempest, as rivers of waters in drought, and the shadow of a rock that standeth out in a desert ground.\n"
	"The eyes of them that see, shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear, shall harken diligently.\n"
	"And the heart of fools shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of mafflers shall speak readily and plain.\n"
	"He that is unwise shall no more be called prince: neither shall the deceitful be called the greater man:\n"
	"for the fool shall speak foolish things, & his heart shall do iniquity, that he may work simulation, and speak to our Lord deceitfully, & make empty the soul of the hungry, and take away drink from the thirsty.\n"
	"The vessels of the deceitful are most wicked: for he hath framed devices to undo the meek, with the word of lying, when the poor man spake judgement.\n"
	"But the prince will think these things, that are worthy of a prince, & he shall stand above the dukes.\n"
	"Ye rich women arise, and hear my voice: ye confident daughters give ear to my speech.\n"
	"For after days & a year you shall be troubled that have confidence: for the vintage is at the end, the gathering will no more come.\n"
	"Be astonied ye rich women, be troubled ye confident: strip you, and be confounded, gird your loins.\n"
	"Mourn upon your breasts, upon the country worthy to be destroyed, upon the fruitful vineyard.\n"
	"Upon the ground of my people shall thorns & briers come up: how much more upon all the houses of joy, of the city rejoicing?\n"
	"For the house is forsaken, the multitude of the city is left, darkness and palpableness are made upon the dens for ever.\n"
	"The joy of wild asses the pastures of flocks, until the spirit be poured out upon us from on high: and the desert shall be as charmel, and charmel shall be reputed for a forest.\n"
	"And judgement shall dwell in the wilderness, and justice shall sit in charmel.\n"
	"And the work of justice shall be peace, and the service of justice silence, and security for ever.\n"
	"And my people shall sit in the beauty of peace, & in the tabernacles of confidence, and in wealthy rest.\n"
	"But hail in falling upon the forest, and the city shall be humbled with lowness.\n"
	"Blessed are ye, that sow upon all waters, sending in the foot of the oxe and the ass.";

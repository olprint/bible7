const char* chap265 = "Therefore all the companies of the Philisthiims were gathered together into Aphec: and Israel also camped upon the fountain, which was in Jezrahel.\n"
	"And the Princes indeed of the Philisthiims marched in hundreds and thousands: but David and his men were in the last company with Achis.\n"
	"And the Princes of the Philisthiims said to Achis: What mean these Hebrews? And Achis said to the Princes of the Philisthiims: Do you not know David, which was the servant of Saul the king of Israel, and is with me many days, or years, and I have not found any thing in him, since the day that he fled to me, until this day?\n"
	"But the Princes of the Philisthiims were angry against him, and said to him: Let this man return, and abide in his place, wherein thou hast appointed him, & let him not go down with us into battle, lest he become an adversary to us, when we shall begin to fight: for how can he otherwise pacify his lord, but in our heads?\n"
	"Is not this David, to whom they sang in dances, saying: Saul hath struck his thousands, and David his ten thousands?\n"
	"Achis therefor called David, and said to him: The Lord liveth, thou art just, and good in my sight: and thy going out, and thy coming in is with me in the camp: and I have not found in thee any evil, since the day that thou camest to me until this day: but thou pleasest not the nobles.\n"
	"Return therefore, and go in peace, and offend not the eyes of the Princes of the Philisthiims.\n"
	"And David said to Achis: For what have I done, and what hast thou found in me thy servant, since the day that I have been in thy fight, until this day, that I may not come, and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?\n"
	"And Achis answering spake to David: I know that thou art good in my sight, as an Angel of God: but the Princes of the Philisthiims have said: He shall not go up with us into battle.\n"
	"Therefore arise in the morning, thou, and the servants of thy lord, which came with thee: and when you are risen in the night, and it shall begin to wax light, go forward.\n"
	"David therefore arose in the night, he and his men, that they might set forward in the morning, and return to the land of the Philisthiims: and the Philisthiims went up into Jezrahel.";

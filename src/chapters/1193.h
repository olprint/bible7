const char* chap1193 = "FOR the which cause thou art inexcusable, o man, whosoever thou be that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou doest the same things which thou judgest.\n"
	"For we know that the judgement of God is according to verity upon them that do such things.\n"
	"And doest thou suppose this, o man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgement of God?\n"
	"Or doest thou contemn the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longanimity, not knowing that the benignity of God bringeth thee to penance?\n"
	"But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou heapest to thyself wrath, in the day of wrath and of the revelation of the just judgement of God,\n"
	"who will render to every man according to his works:\n"
	"to them truly that according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, life eternal;\n"
	"but to them that are of contention, and that obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.\n"
	"Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first and of the Greek:\n"
	"but glory and honour and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first and to the Greek.\n"
	"For there is no acception of persons with God.\n"
	"For whosoever have sinned without the Law, without the Law shall perish: and whosoever have sinned in the Law, by the Law shall be judged.\n"
	"For not the hearers of the Law are just with God: but the doers of the Law shall be justified.\n"
	"For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, naturally do those things that are of the Law; the same not having the Law, themselves are a law to themselves:\n"
	"who shew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience giving testimony to them, and among themselves mutually their thoughts accusing, or also defending,\n"
	"in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my Gospel, by JESUS CHRIST.\n"
	"But if thou be surnamed a Jew, and restest in the Law, and doest glory in God,\n"
	"and knowest his will, and approvest the more profitable things, instructed by the Law,\n"
	"presumest that thyself art a leader of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,\n"
	"a teacher of the foolish, a master of infants, having the form of science & of verity in the Law.\n"
	"Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest not thyself: that preachest, men ought not to steal, thou stealest:\n"
	"that sayest men should not commit adultery, thou committest adultery: that abhorrest idols, thou doest sacrilege:\n"
	"that doest glory in the Law, thou by prevarication of the Law doest dishonour God.\n"
	"(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)\n"
	"Circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou observe the Law: but if thou be a prevaricator of the Law, thy circumcision is become prepuce.\n"
	"If then the prepuce keep the justices of the Law; shall not his prepuce be reputed for circumcision?\n"
	"and shall not that which of nature is prepuce, fulfilling the Law, judge thee, that by the letter and circumcision art a prevaricator of the Law?\n"
	"For not he that is in open shew, is a Jew, nor that which is in open shew, in the flesh, is circumcision:\n"
	"but he that is in secret, is a Jew; and the circumcision of the heart, in spirit, not in the letter: whose praise is not of men, but of God.";

const char* chap1168 = "BUT a certain man named Ananias, with Saphira his wife sold a piece of land,\n"
	"and defrauded of the price of the land, his wife being privy thereto: and bringing a certain portion, laid it at the feet of the Apostles.\n"
	"And Peter said: Ananias, why hath Satan tempted thy heart, that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Ghost, and defraud of the price of the land?\n"
	"Remaining, did it not remain to thee: and being sold, was it not in thy power? Why hast thou put this thing in thy heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God.\n"
	"And Ananias hearing these words, fell down, and gave up the ghost. And there came great fear upon all that heard it.\n"
	"And young men rising up, removed him, & bearing him forth buried him.\n"
	"And it was the space as it were of three hours, and his wife, not knowing what was chanced, came in.\n"
	"And Peter answered her: Tell me woman, whether did you sell the land for so much? But she said: Yea, for so much.\n"
	"And Peter unto her: Why have you agreed together to tempt the Spirit of our Lord? Behold, their feet that have buried thy husband, at the door, and they shall bear thee forth.\n"
	"Forthwith she fell before his feet, and gave up the ghost. And the young men going in, found her dead: and carried her forth, & buried her by her husband.\n"
	"And there fell great fear in the whole Church, and upon all that heard these things.\n"
	"And by the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people. And they were all with one accord in Salomon's porch.\n"
	"But of the rest none durst join themselves unto them: but the people magnified them.\n"
	"And the multitude of men and women that believed in our Lord, was more increased:\n"
	"so that they did bring forth the sick into the streets, & laid them in beds and couches, that when Peter came, his shadow at the least might overshadow any of them, and they all might be delivered from their infirmities.\n"
	"And there ran together unto Jerusalem the multitude also of the cities adjoining, bringing sick persons and such as were vexed of unclean spirits; who were all cured.\n"
	"And the high Priest rising up, and all that were with him, which is the heresy of the Sadducees, were replenished with zeal:\n"
	"laid hands upon the Apostles, and put them in the common prison.\n"
	"But an Angel of our Lord by night opening the gates of the prison, & leading them forth, said:\n"
	"Go; and standing speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.\n"
	"Who having heard this, early in the morning entered into the temple, and taught. And the high priest coming, and they that were with him, called together the Council & all the ancients of the children of Israel: and they sent to the prison that they might be brought.\n"
	"But when the ministers were come, and opening the prison, found them not; returning they told, saying:\n"
	"The prison truly we found shut with all diligence, and the keepers standing before the gates: but opening it, we found no man within.\n"
	"And as soon as the Magistrates of the temple and the chief Priests heard these words, they were in doubt of them, what would befall.\n"
	"And there came a certain man and told them: That the men, lo, which you did put in prison, are in the temple standing, and teaching the people.\n"
	"Then went the Magistrate with the ministers, & brought them without force, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.\n"
	"And when they had brought them, they set them in the Council. And the high Priest asked them,\n"
	"saying: Commanding we commanded you that you should not teach in this name: and behold you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and you will bring upon us the blood of this man.\n"
	"But Peter answering and the Apostles, said: God must be obeyed, rather than men.\n"
	"The God of our Fathers hath raised up JESUS, whom you did kill, hanging him upon a tree.\n"
	"This Prince and Saviour God hath exalted with his right hand, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.\n"
	"And we are witnesses of these words, and the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to all that obey him.\n"
	"When they had heard these things, it cut them to the heart, and they consulted to kill them.\n"
	"But one in the Council rising up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a Doctor of law honourable to all the people, commanded the men to be put forth a while.\n"
	"and he said to them: Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves touching these men what you mean to do.\n"
	"For before these days there rose Theodas, saying he was somebody, to whom consented a number of men about four hundred, who was slain: and all that believed him, were dispersed, and brought to nothing.\n"
	"After this fellow there rose Judas of Galilee in the days of the Enrolling, and drew away the people after him, and he perished: and as many as ever consented to him, were dispersed.\n"
	"And now therefore I say to you, depart from these men and let them alone: for if this counsel or work be of men, it will be dissolved:\n"
	"but if it be of God, you are not able to dissolve them, lest perhaps you be found to resist God also. And they consented to him.\n"
	"And calling in the Apostles, after they had scourged them, they charged them that they should not speak in the name of JESUS, and dismissed them.\n"
	"And they went from the sight of the Council rejoicing, because they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of JESUS.\n"
	"And every day they ceased not in the temple, and from house to house to teach and evangelize Christ JESUS.";

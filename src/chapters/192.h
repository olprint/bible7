const char* chap192 = "Therefore after that all the kings of the Ammorrheites, which dwelt beyond Jordan at the west side, and all the kings of Chanaan, which possessed the places nigh to the great sea, had heard that our Lord had dried the streams of Jordan before the children of Israel, till they passed over, their heart failed, and there remained no spirit in them, fearing the entering of the children of Israel.\n"
	"At that time our Lord said to Josue: Make thee knives of stone, and circumcise the second time the children of Israel.\n"
	"He did that which our Lord had commanded, and he circumcised the children of Israel in the hill of the prepuces.\n"
	"And this is the cause of the second circumcision: All the people, that came out of Aegypt of the malekind, all the fighting men died in the desert by the long circuits of the way,\n"
	"who were all circumcised. But the people that was born in the desert,\n"
	"during the forty years of the journey in the wide wilderness was uncircumcised: till they were consumed that had not heard the voice of our Lord, and to whom he had sworn before, that he would not shew them a land flowing with milk and honey.\n"
	"The children of these succeeded in the place of the fathers, and were circumcised of Josue: for they were in the prepuce even as they were born, neither had any circumcised them in the way.\n"
	"And after that they were all circumcised, they abode in the same place of the camp, until they were whole.\n"
	"And our Lord said to Josue: This day have I taken away the reproach of Aegypt from you. And the name of that place was called Galgal, until this present day.\n"
	"And the children of Israel abode in Galgal, & they made the Phase, the fourteenth day of the month at even, in the champion of Jericho:\n"
	"and they did eat of the corn of the Land the next day, azyme loaves and polent of the same year.\n"
	"And Manna failed after they did eat of the corn of the Land, neither did the children of Israel use that meat any more, but they did eat of the corn of the present Land of Chanaan.\n"
	"And when Josue was in the field of the city of Jericho, he lifted up his eyes, and saw a man standing against him, holding a drawn sword, and he went to him, and said: Art thou ours, or our adversaries'?\n"
	"Who answered: No: but I am a prince of the host of our Lord, and now I come.\n"
	"Josue fell flat on the ground. And adoring he said: What speaketh my Lord to his servant?\n"
	"Loose, saith he, thy shoe from thy feet: for the place wherein thou dost stand, is holy, And Josue did as it was commanded him.";

	"That I should preach the placable year to the Lord, & the day of vengeance of our God: that I might comfort all that mourn;\n"
	"that I might appoint to the mourners of Sion, & give them a crown for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, a mantle of praise for the spirit of sorrowfulness: and they shall be called in it the strong of justice, planting of the Lord to glorify.\n"
	"And they shall build the deserts from the beginning of the world, and shall erect the old ruins; and shall repair the desolate cities, that were dissipated in generation and generation.\n"

	"Rejoicing I will rejoice in our Lord, and my soul shall be joyful in my God: because he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation: and with the garment of justice he hath compassed me, as a bridegroom decked with a crown, and as a bride adorned with her jewels.\n"
	"For as the earth bringeth forth her spring, and as the garden shooteth forth his seed: so shall our Lord God make justice to spring forth, and praise before all the Gentiles.";

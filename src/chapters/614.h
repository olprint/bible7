	"and I shall understand in the immaculate way, when thou shalt come to me. I walked through in the innocency of my heart, in the midst of my house.\n"
	"I did not propose before mine eyes any unjust thing: I hated them that do prevarication.\n"
	"A perverse heart hath not cleaved to me: the malignant declining from me I knew not.\n"
	"One secretly detracting from his neighbour, him did I persecute. One of a proud eye, and unsatiable heart, with him I did not eat.\n"
	"Mine eyes are towards the faithful of the earth that they may sit with me. A man that walketh in the immaculate way he did minister to me.\n"
	"He that doth proudly shall not dwell in the midst of my house: he that speaketh unjust things, hath not directed in the sight of mine eyes.\n"
	"In the morning did I kill all the sinners of the earth: that I might destroy out of the city of our Lord all those that work iniquity.";

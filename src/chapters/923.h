	"And behold six men came from the way of the upper gate, which looketh to the North: and every man's weapon of destruction in his hand: one man also in the midst of them was clothed with linen garments, and the ink-horn of a writer at his reins: and they entered in, and stood by the brazen altar.\n"
	"And the glory of the Lord of Israel was taken up from the Cherub, which was over him to the threshold of the house: and he called the man, that was clothed with the linen garments, and had the ink-horn of a writer on his loins.\n"
	"And our Lord said to him: Pass through the midst of the city in the midst of Jerusalem: and sign Thau upon the foreheads of the men that mourn and lament upon all the abominations, that are done in the midst thereof.\n"
	"And to them he said in my hearing: Pass through the city following him, and strike: let not your eye spare, neither have ye mercy.\n"
	"The old, the young man, and the virgin, the little one, and the women kill to utter destruction: but every one upon whom you shall see Thau, kill not, and begin ye at my Sanctuary: They began therefore at the ancient men, which were before the face of the house.\n"
	"And he said to them: Contaminate the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and struck them that were in the city.\n"
	"And the slaughter being accomplished I remained: and I fell upon my face, and crying: I said Alas, alas, alas o Lord God, wilt thou then destroy all the remnant of Israel, pouring out thy fury upon Jerusalem?\n"
	"And he said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel, and Juda is exceeding great, and the land is replenished with blood, and the city is replenished with aversion: for they have said: Our Lord hath forsaken the earth, and our Lord seeth not.\n"
	"Therefore mine eye also shall not spare, neither will I have mercy: I will requite their way upon their head.\n"
	"And behold the man, that was clothed with the linen garments, that had the ink-horn at his back, answered a word, saying: I have done as thou hast commanded me.";

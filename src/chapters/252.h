const char* chap252 = "And our Lord said to Samuel: How long dost thou mourn Saul, whom I have rejected that he rule not over Israel? Fill thy horn with oil, and come, that I may send thee to Isai the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.\n"
	"And Samuel said: How shall I go? For Saul will hear of it, and will kill me. And our Lord said: A calf of the herd shalt thou take in thy hand, and shalt say: I am come to immolate unto our Lord.\n"
	"And thou shalt call Isai to the victim, and I will shew thee what thou must do, and thou shalt anoint whomsoever I shall shew to thee.\n"
	"Samuel therefore did as our Lord spake to him. And he came into Bethlehem, and the ancients of the city marveled meeting him, and they said: Is thy entrance peaceable?\n"
	"And he said: Peaceable: I am come to immolate unto our Lord, be ye sanctified and come with me that I may immolate. He therefore sanctified Isai and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.\n"
	"And when they were entered in, he saw Eliab, and said: Is there before our Lord his Christ?\n"
	"And our Lord said to Samuel: Respect not his countenance, nor the tallness of his stature: because I have rejected him, neither do I judge according to the look of man: for man seeth those things which appear, but our Lord beholdeth the heart.\n"
	"And Isai called Aminadab, and brought him before Samuel. Who said: Neither this hath our Lord chosen.\n"
	"And Isai brought Samma, of whom he said: This also hath not our Lord chosen.\n"
	"Isai therefore brought his seven sons before Samuel: & Samuel said to Isai: Our Lord hath not chosen of these.\n"
	"And Samuel said to Isai: Are all thy sons now fully come? Who answered: Yet there is left a little one, & he feedeth sheep. And Samuel said to Isai: Send, and bring him: for neither will we sit down till he come hither.\n"
	"He sent therefore, and brought him. And he was red and beautiful to behold, and of a comely face. And our Lord said: Arise, and anoint him, for he it is.\n"
	"Samuel therefore took the horn of oil, & anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of our Lord from that day & so forward was directed upon David: & Samuel rising went into Ramatha.\n"
	"And the Spirit of our Lord departed from Saul, and a wicked spirit vexed him, from our Lord.\n"
	"And the servants of Saul said to him: Behold an evil spirit of God vexeth thee.\n"
	"Let our Lord command, and thy servants which are before thee will seek a man skillful to play on the harp, that when the evil spirit of our Lord shall take thee, he may play with his hand, and thou bear it more easily.\n"
	"And Saul said to his servants: Provide me therefore some man that playeth well, and bring him to me.\n"
	"And one of the servants answering, said: Behold I have seen the son of Isai the Bethlehemite skillful to play, and very valiant in strength, and a warlike man, and wise in his words, & a beautiful man: and our Lord is with him.\n"
	"Saul therefore sent messengers to Isai saying: Send unto me David thy son, which is in the pastures.\n"
	"Isai therefore took an ass loaden with loaves, and a flagon of wine, and one kid of the goats, and sent it by the hand of David his son to Saul.\n"
	"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: but he loved him exceedingly, and was made his esquire.\n"
	"And Saul sent to Isai, saying: Let David stand in my sight: for he hath found grace in mine eyes.\n"
	"Therefore whensoever the evil spirit of our Lord caught Saul, David took his harp, & struck with his hand, & Saul was refreshed, and waxed better, for the evil spirit departed from him.";

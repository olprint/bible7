const char* chap8 = "And God remembered Noe, and all the beasts, and all the cattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters decreased.\n"
	"And the fountains of the depth and the flood-gates of heaven were shut up: and the rain from heaven was stayed.\n"
	"And the waters returned from the earth going & coming: and they began to decrease after an hundred fifty days.\n"
	"And the ark rested the seventh month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia.\n"
	"But the waters for all that^ were going and decreasing until the tenth month: for in the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.\n"
	"And after that forty days were passed, Noe opening the window of the ark, which he had made, let forth a crow:\n"
	"which went forth, and did not return, till the waters were dried upon the earth.\n"
	"He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters were ceased yet upon the face of the earth.\n"
	"Which finding not where her foot might rest, returned to him into the ark: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he stretched forth his hand and caught her, and brought her into the ark.\n"
	"And having expected yet seven more days again he let forth a dove out of the ark.\n"
	"But she came to him at eventide, carrying a bough of an olive tree that had green leaves, in her mouth. Noe therefore understood that the waters were ceased upon the earth.\n"
	"And he expected yet nevertheless other seven days: and he sent forth a dove, which returned not any more unto him.\n"
	"Therefore in the sixth hundred and one year, the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were clean diminished upon the earth: & Noe opening the roof of the ark, looked, and saw that the face of the earth was dried.\n"
	"In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of the month the earth was dried.\n"
	"And God spake to Noe, saying:\n"
	"Go forth of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons and the wives of thy sons with thee.\n"
	"All cattle that are with thee, of all flesh, as well in fowls, as in beasts, and all creepers that creep upon the earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increase and multiply upon it.\n"
	"Noe therefore went forth, and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.\n"
	"Yea and all cattle, beasts, & creepers that creep upon the earth, according to their kind, went forth out of the ark.\n"
	"And Noe built an Altar to our Lord: and taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean, offered Holocausts upon the Altar.\n"
	"And our Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said: I will no more curse the earth for men: for the sense and cogitation of man's heart are prone to evil from their youth: I will no more therefore strike every living soul as I have done.\n"
	"All the days of the earth, seed-time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night and day shall not rest.";

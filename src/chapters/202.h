const char* chap202 = "Therefore the lot of the children of Judas by their kindreds was this: From the border of Edom, unto the desert of Sin against the South, and unto the uttermost part of the south coast.\n"
	"the beginning thereof was from the top of the most salt sea, and from the brink thereof, that looketh to the South.\n"
	"And it goeth forth against the Ascent of the Scorpion, & passeth through into Sina: and riseth up into Cadesbarne, and reacheth into Esron, ascending to Addar, and compassing Carcaa,\n"
	"and thence passing through into Asemona, & reaching to the Torrent of Aegypt: and the borders thereof shall be the great sea. This shall be the end of the south coast.\n"
	"But on the East side the beginning shall be the most salt sea unto the utmost parts of Jordan: & those places that look to the North from the brink of the sea unto the same river of Jordan.\n"
	"And the border goeth up into Beth Hagla, and passeth from the north into Beth Araba: ascending to the stone of Bohen the son of Ruben.\n"
	"And reaching as far as the borders of Debera from the Valley of Achor, against the North looking toward Galgal, which is opposite to the Ascent of Adommim, on the south side of the torrent: and passeth the waters, that are called The Fountain of the sun: and the ends thereof shall be to the Fountain Rogel.\n"
	"And it ascendeth by the Valley of the son of Ennom on the side of the Jebusite toward the South, this is Jerusalem: and thence rearing it-self to the top of the mountain, which is against Geennom toward the West in the top of the Valley of Raphaim against the North.\n"
	"And it passeth through from the top of the mountain to the fountain of the water Nephtoa: and reacheth to the towns of mount Ephron: and bendeth into Baala, which is Cariathiarim, that is to say, a city of woods.\n"
	"And it compasseth from Baala against the West, unto mount Seir: and passeth by the side of mount Iarim toward the North into Cheslon: and goeth down into Bethsames, and passeth into Thamna.\n"
	"And it reacheth toward the North coast of a part of Accaron at the side: and bendeth to Sechrona, and passeth mount Baala: and cometh into Iebneel, and is shut up with the end of the great sea toward the West.\n"
	"These are the borders of the children of Judas in circuit in their kindreds.\n"
	"But to Caleb the son of Jephone he gave a portion in the midst of the children of Judas, as our Lord had commanded him: Cariath Arbe the father of Enac, that is Hebron.\n"
	"And Caleb destroyed out of it the three sons of Enac, Sesai and Ahiman and Tholmai of the stock of Enac.\n"
	"And from thence going up he came to the inhabitants of Dabir, which before was called Cariath Sepher, that is to say, a city of letters.\n"
	"And Caleb said: He that shall strike Cariath-sepher, and take it, I will give him Axa my daughter to wife.\n"
	"And Othoniel the son of Cenez, the younger brother of Caleb took it: & he gave him Axa his daughter to wife.\n"
	"Who going together, she was moved by her husband to ask a field of her father, and she sighed as she sat on her ass. To whom Caleb said: What aileth thee?\n"
	"But she answered: Give me a blessing: A South and dry Land thou hast given me, join also a watery. Caleb therefore gave her a watery ground above & beneath.\n"

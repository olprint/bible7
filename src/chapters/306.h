const char* chap306 = "Therefore in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nabat, Abias reigned over Juda.\n"
	"Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Maacha the daughter of Abessalom.\n"
	"And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: neither was his heart perfect with our Lord his God, as the heart of David his father.\n"
	"But for David's sake our Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, that he might raise up his son after him, and establish Jerusalem:\n"
	"because David had done right in the eyes of our Lord, & had not declined from all things, which he commanded him, all the days of his life, except the matter of Urias the Hetheite.\n"
	"But there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam all the time of his life.\n"
	"And the rest of the words of Abias, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the words of the kings of Juda? And there was war between Abias and Jeroboam.\n"
	"And Abias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned for him.\n"
	"In the twentieth year therefore of Jeroboam the king of Israel reigned Asa the king of Juda.\n"
	"And he reigned one and forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacha, the daughter of Abessalom.\n"
	"And Asa did right before the sight of our Lord, as David his father:\n"
	"and he took away the effeminate out of the land, and he purged all the filth of the idols, which his fathers had made.\n"
	"Moreover he removed also Maacha his mother, that she should not be Princess in the sacrifice of Priapus, and in the grove which she had consecrated: and he destroyed her den, and brake the most filthy idol, and burnt it in the torrent cedron:\n"
	"but the excelses he did not take away. Otherwise the heart of Asa was perfect with our Lord all his days:\n"
	"and he carried in those things, which his father had sanctified & vowed, into the house of our Lord, silver and gold, and vessels.\n"
	"And there was war between Asa and Baasa the king of Israel all their days.\n"
	"Baasa also the king of Israel went up into Juda, and built Rama, that no man might go out or come in of Asa's side the king of Juda.\n"
	"Asa therefore taking all the silver and gold that remained in the treasures of the house of our Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house, gave it into the hands of his servants: and he sent to Benadad the son of Tabremon the son of Hezion, the king of Syria, which dwelt in Damascus, saying:\n"
	"There is a league between me and thee, and betwixt my father and thy father: therefore I have sent thee gifts, silver and gold: and I desire thee that thou come, and make void the league, that thou hast with Baasa the king of Israel, and he may retire from me.\n"
	"Benadad agreeing to king Asa, sent the Princes of his army into the cities of Israel, and they struck Ahion, & Dan, & Abeldomum of Maacha, & all Cenneroth, to wit, all the Land of Nephthali.\n"
	"Which when Baasa had heard, he intermitted to build Rama, & returned into Thersa.\n"
	"But king Asa sent word into all Juda, saying: Let no man be excused, and they took stones from Rama, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasa had built, & Asa of it built Gabaa Benjamin and Maspha.\n"
	"But the rest of all the words of Asa, & all his forces, & all that he did, & the cities that he built, are not these written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? Howbeit in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.\n"
	"And he slept with his fathers, & was buried with them in the city of David his father. And Josaphat his son reigned for him.\n"
	"But Nadab the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel the second year of Asa the King of Juda: and he reigned over Israel two years.\n"
	"And he did that which is evil in the sight of our Lord, & walked in the ways of his father, and in his sins, wherewith he made Israel to sin.\n"
	"And Baasa the son of Ahias of the house of Issachar, lay in wait against him, & struck him in Gebbethon, which is a city of the Philisthiims: for Nadab & all Israel besieged Gebbethon.\n"
	"Baasa therefore slew him in the third year of Asa the King of Juda, and reigned for him.\n"
	"And when he reigned, he struck all the house of Jeroboam: he left not so much as one soul of his seed, till he destroyed him according to the word of our Lord, which he had spoken in the hand of Ahias the Silonite,\n"
	"for the sins of Jeroboam, which he had sinned, & wherewith he had caused Israel to sin, and for the offence, wherewith he provoked our Lord the God of Israel.\n"
	"But the rest of the words of Nadab, and all that he wrought, are not these things written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?\n"
	"And there was war between Asa and Baasa the King of Israel all their days.\n"
	"In the third year of Asa the King of Juda, reigned Baasa the son of Ahias over all Israel in Thersa four & twenty years.\n"
	"And he did evil before our Lord, and walked in the ways of Jeroboam, and in his sins, wherewith he made Israel to sin.";

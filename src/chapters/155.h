const char* chap155 = "And departing thence we came into the wilderness, that leadeth to the Red sea, as our Lord had said to me: and we compassed the mountain Seir a long time.\n"
	"And our Lord said to me:\n"
	"It is sufficient for you to have compassed this mountain: go toward the North.\n"
	"And command thou the people, saying: You shall pass by the borders of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir, and they will be afraid of you.\n"
	"Look diligently therefore that you stir not against them. For I will not give you of their land so much as the step of one foot can tread, because I have given the mountain Seir to be the possession of Esau.\n"
	"Meats you shall buy of them with money, and shall eat: bought water shall you draw, and drink.\n"
	"The Lord thy God hath blessed thee in every work of thy hands: he knoweth thy journey; how thou hast passed this great wilderness, for forty years the Lord thy God dwelling with thee, and thou hast wanted nothing.\n"
	"And when we had passed by our brethren the children of Esau, that dwelt in Seir, by the champion way from Elath and from Asiongaber, we came to the way, that leadeth into the desert of Moab.\n"
	"And our Lord said to me: Fight not against the Moabites, neither make battle against them: for I will not give thee any of their land, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot in possession.\n"
	"Emim first were the inhabiters thereof, a great people, and valiant, and so tall that they were thought,\n"
	"as it were giants, of the Enacims' stock, and were like the children of the Enacims. Moreover the Moabites call them Emim.\n"
	"But in Seir before dwelt the Horrins: who being expelled and destroyed, the children of Esau did inhabit it, as Israel did in the land of his possession, which our Lord gave him.\n"
	"Rising up therefore to pass the Torrent Zared, we came to it.\n"
	"And the time, that we walked from Cadesbarne unto the passage of the torrent Zared, was thirty and eight years: until all the generation of the men that were warriors was consumed out of the camp, as our Lord had sworn:\n"
	"whose hand was against them, that they should perish from among the camp.\n"
	"And after all the warriors were dead,\n"
	"our Lord spake to me, saying:\n"
	"Thou shalt pass this day the borders of Moab, the city named Ar:\n"
	"and approaching unto the frontiers of the children of Ammon, beware thou fight not against them, neither once move to battle: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon, because I have given it to the children of Lot in possession.\n"
	"It was reputed the land of giants: and giants in old time dwelt in it, whom the Ammonites call Zomzommim,\n"
	"a great and huge people, & of long stature, as the Enacims whom our Lord destroyed before their face: and he made them to dwell in their stead,\n"
	"as he had done to the children of Esau, that dwelt in Seir, destroying the Horrheites, and delivering their land to them, which they possess until this present.\n"
	"The Heveites also, that dwelt in Haserim as far as Gaza, the Capadocians expelled: who issuing out of Capadocia, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.\n"
	"Arise ye, and pass the torrent Arnon: behold I have delivered in thy hand Sehon king of Hesebon the Amorrhite, and begin to possess his land, and make war against him.\n"
	"This day will I begin to send thy terror and fear upon the peoples, that dwell under the whole heaven: that hearing thy name they may quake, and tremble after the manner of women in travail, and be pinched with sorrow.\n"
	"I sent therefore messengers from the wilderness of Cademoth to Sehon the king of Hesebon with peaceable words, saying:\n"
	"We will pass through thy land, we will go the common high way: we will not decline neither to the right hand, nor to the left.\n"
	"Sell us meats for money, that we may eat: give us water for money, and so we will drink. Only this, that thou wilt grant us passage,\n"
	"as the children of Esau have done, that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites, that abide in Ar: until we come to Jordan, and pass to the Land, which the Lord our God will give us.\n"
	"And Sehon the king of Hesebon would not give us passage: because the Lord thy God had indurated his spirit, and hardened his heart, that he might be delivered into thy hands, as now thou seest.\n"
	"And our Lord said to me: Behold I have begun to deliver Sehon unto thee, and his land, begin to possess it.\n"
	"And Sehon came forth to meet us with all his people to battle in Jasa.\n"
	"And the Lord our God delivered him to us: and we smote him with his sons and all his people.\n"
	"And all his cities we took at that time, killing the inhabiters thereof, men and women and little ones. We left nothing among them.\n"
	"Except the cattle, which came to their portion that took preys: and the spoils of the cities, which we took\n"
	"from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, a town that is situated in a valley, as far as Galaad. There was not a village or city, that escaped our hands: the Lord our God delivered all unto us.\n"
	"Except the land of the children of Ammon, to the which we approached not: and all that adjoin to the torrent Jeboc, and the cities on the mountain, and all the places, from which the Lord our God prohibited us.";

	"made war against Barra the king of Sodome, and against Bersa the king of Gomorra, and against Sennaab the king of Adama, and against Semebar the king of Seboim, and against the king of Bala, the same is Segor.\n"
	"All these came together into the wood-land vale, which now is the salt sea.\n"
	"For they had served Chodorlahomor twelve years, & the thirteenth year they revolted from him.\n"
	"Therefore in the fourteenth year came Chodorlahomor, and the kings that were with him, and they struck Raphaim in Astarothcarnaim, and Susim with them, and Emim in Savee of Cariathaim,\n"
	"and the Corrheans in the mountains of Seir, even to the Champion country of Pharan, which is in the wilderness.\n"
	"And they returned, and came as far as the fountain of Misphat, the same is Cades: and they struck all the country of the Amelechites, and of the Amorrheans, that dwell in Asasonthamar.\n"
	"And they went forth the king of Sodome, and the king of Gomorra, and the king of Adama, and the king of Seboim, moreover also the king of Bala, which is Segor: and they set themselves against them in battle array in the wood-land vale:\n"
	"to wit against Chodorlahomor king of the Elamites, and Thadal king of Nations, and Amraphel king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Pontus: four kings against five.\n"
	"But the wood-land vale had many pits of bitume. Therefore the king of Sodome and of Gomorra turned their backs, and were overthrown there: and they that remained fled to the mountain.\n"
	"And they took all the substance of the Sodomites and Gomorrheans, and took all kind of victuals, and went their way:\n"
	"and Lot also and his substance, the son of Abrams brother, who dwelled in Sodom.\n"
	"And behold one that had escaped told Abram the Hebrew, that dwelt in the vale of Mambre, the Amorrean, brother of Eschol, and the brother of Aner: for these made a league with Abram.\n"
	"Which when Abram had heard, to wit, that his brother Lot was taken, he numbered of the servants born in his house, well appointed, three hundred and eighteen: and pursued them unto Dan.\n"
	"And dividing his company, he ran upon them in the night, and struck them, and pursued them unto Hoba, which is on the left hand of Damascus.\n"
	"And he brought back all the substance, and Lot his brother with his substance, the women also and the people.\n"
	"And the king of Sodom went forth to meet them, after he returned from the slaughter of Chodorlahomor, and of the kings that were with him in the vale Savee, which is the king's vale.\n"
	"But Melchisedech the king of Salem, bringing forth bread and wine, for he was the Priest of God most High,\n"
	"blessed him, and said: Blessed be Abram to God the Highest, which created heaven and earth:\n"
	"and blessed be God the Highest, by whose protection the enemies are in thy hands. And he gave him the tithes of all.\n"
	"And the king of Sodom said to Abram: Give me the souls, and the rest take to thee.\n"
	"Who answered him: I lift up my hand to my Lord God most High, possessor of heaven and earth,\n"
	"that from the very woof-thread unto the shoe latchet, I will not take of all that are thine, lest thou say, I have enriched Abram:\n"
	"except such things as the young men have eaten, and the shares of the men that came with me, Aner, Eschol, and Mambre: these shall take their shares.";

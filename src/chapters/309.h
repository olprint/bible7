const char* chap309 = "After many days the word of our Lord came to Elias, the third year, saying: Go, and shew thyself to Achab, that I may give rain upon the face of the earth.\n"
	"Elias therefore went to shew himself to Achab: and there was sore famine in Samaria.\n"
	"And Achab called Abdias the governor of his house: And Abdias did fear our Lord very much.\n"
	"For when Jezabel killed the Prophets, of our Lord, he took an hundred Prophets, and hid them by fifty and fifty in caves, and fed them with bread and water.\n"
	"Achab therefore said to Abdias: Go into the land to all the fountains of waters, and into all valleys, if perhaps we may find grass, and save the horses and mules, and the beasts may not utterly perish.\n"
	"And they divided the countries between them, that they might go circuit about them: Achab went one way, and Abdias another way severally.\n"
	"And when Abdias was in the way, Elias met him: who when he knew him, fell on his face, and said: My lord, art not thou Elias?\n"
	"To whom he answered: I am. Go, and tell thy lord: Elias is here.\n"
	"And he said: What have I sinned, that thou deliverest me thy servant into the hand of Achab, that he may kill me?\n"
	"Our Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or Kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee; and all answering: He is not here; he adjured all kingdoms and nations, for that thou wast not found.\n"
	"And now thou sayest to me: Go, and tell thy lord, Elias is here.\n"
	"And when I am departed from thee, the Spirit of our Lord will carry thee into a place, that I know not: and I entering in shall tell Achab, and not finding thee, he will kill me: and thy servant feareth our Lord from his infancy.\n"
	"Hath it not been told thee my lord, what I did when Jezabel killed the Prophets of our Lord, that I hid of the Prophets of our Lord an hundred men, by fifty and fifty in caves, and fed them with bread and water?\n"
	"And now thou sayst: Go, and tell thy lord: Elias is here: that he may kill me?\n"
	"And Elias said: The Lord of hosts liveth, before whose face I stand, this day will I appear to him.\n"
	"Abdias therefore went to meet Achab, and told him: and Achab came to meet Elias.\n"
	"And when he had seen him, he said: Art thou he that doest trouble Israel?\n"
	"And he said: not I have troubled Israel, but thou, and the house of thy father, who have forsaken the commandments of our Lord, & have followed Baalim.\n"
	"Nevertheless send now, and gather unto me all Israel in the mount of Carmel, and the Prophets of Baal four hundred fifty, and the Prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat of Jezabel's table.\n"
	"Achab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered together the Prophets in the mount of Carmel.\n"
	"And Elias coming to all the people, said: How long halt you on two sides? If our Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, follow him. And the people did not answer him a word.\n"
	"And Elias said again to the people: I only remain a Prophet of our Lord: and the Prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men.\n"
	"Let two oxen be given us, and let them choose to themselves one oxe, and cutting it into pieces let them lay it upon wood, but put no fire under: and I will dress the other oxe, and will lay it upon wood, and put no fire under.\n"
	"Invocate ye the names of your gods, & I will invocate the name of my Lord: and the God that shall hear by fire, let the same be God. And all the people answering said, A very good proposition.\n"
	"Elias therefore said to the Prophets of Baal: Choose you one oxe, and make it first, because you are many: and invocate the names of your gods, and put no fire under.\n"
	"Who when they had taken the oxe, which he gave them, they dressed it: and they invocated the name of Baal from morning until midday, saying: Baal hear us. And there was no voice, nor any that answered: and they leaped over the altar, that they had made.\n"
	"And when it was now midday, Elias jested at them, saying: Cry with a louder voice: for he is God, and perhaps he speaketh, or is in his inn, or in the way, or at the least he sleepeth, that he must be waked.\n"
	"They cried therefore with a loud voice, and cut themselves after their rite with knives and lancets, till they were all imbrued with blood.\n"
	"And after the midday was past, and whilst they prophesied, the time was come, when they used to offer sacrifice, neither voice was heard, nor any did answer, nor attend them praying:\n"
	"Elias said to all the people: Come unto me. And the people coming to him, he repaired the altar of our Lord, that was destroyed.\n"
	"And he took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the children of Jacob, to whom the word of our Lord came, saying: Israel shall be thy name.\n"
	"And he built of the stones an altar in the name of our Lord: and he made a water gutter, as it were by two furrows round about the altar,\n"
	"And he laid the wood in order, and divided the oxe in joints, and laid it upon the wood,\n"
	"and said: Fill four buckets with water, and pour upon the holocaust, and upon the wood. And again he said: Do it also the second time. Who having done it the second time, he said: The third time also do the same. And they did so the third time,\n"
	"and the waters ran about the altar, and the trough of the conduit was filled.\n"
	"And when it was now time that the holocaust should be offered, Elias the Prophet coming said: Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, shew this day that thou art the God of Israel, and I thy servant, and that according to thy commandment I have done all these things.\n"
	"Hear me Lord, hear me that this people may learn, that thou art our Lord God, and thou hast converted their heart again.\n"
	"And the fire of our Lord fell, and devoured the holocaust, and the wood, and the stones, licking also the dust, and the water, that was in the water gutter.\n"
	"Which when all the people had seen, they fell on their face, and said: Our Lord he is God, our Lord he is God.\n"
	"And Elias said to them: Apprehend the Prophets of Baal, and let not one escape of them. Whom when they had taken, Elias brought them to the Torrent Cison, and killed them there.\n"
	"And Elias said to Achab: Go up, eat and drink: because there is sound of much rain.\n"
	"Achab went up to eat and drink: and Elias went up into the top of Carmel, and flat on the earth put his face between his knees,\n"
	"and he said to his servant: Go up, and look toward the sea. Who when he was gone up, and had looked, he said: There is nothing. And again he said to him: Return seven times\n"
	"And in the seventh time: Behold a little cloud as it were a man's foot came up from the sea. Who said: Go up and say to Achab: Yoke thy chariot and go down, lest the rain prevent thee.\n"
	"And when he turned himself hither and thither, behold the heavens were darkened, and clouds, and wind, and there fell great rain. Achab therefore going up went into Jezrahel:\n"
	"and the hand of our Lord was made upon Elias, and his loins girded he ran before Achab, until he came into Jezrahel.";

	"Who going about Juda, gathered together the Levites out of all the cities of Juda, and the princes of the families of Israel, and they came into Jerusalem.\n"
	"Therefore all the multitude made a covenant with the king in the house of God: and Joiada said to them: Behold the king's son shall reign, as our Lord hath spoken, upon the sons of David.\n"
	"This therefore is the thing which you shall do.\n"
	"The third part of you that come to the Sabbath of the Priests, and of Levites, and of porters, shall be in the gates: and a third part at the king's house: and a third at the gate, which is called of the Foundation: but all the rest of the common people be in the courts of the house of our Lord.\n"
	"Neither let any other enter into the house of our Lord, but the Priests, and they that minister of the Levites: let them only go in, because they are sanctified, and let all the rest of the multitude observe the watches of our Lord.\n"
	"And let the Levites environ the king, having every one their weapons: (and if any other shall enter into the temple, let him be slain) and let them be with the king both coming in, and going out.\n"
	"The Levites therefore, and all Juda did according to all things, which Joiada the high Priest had commanded, and they took every one the men that were under them, and came by the order of the Sabbath, with them that had fulfilled the Sabbath, and were to go forth. For Joiada the high Priest permitted not the companies to depart, which were accustomed to succeed one another every week.\n"
	"And Joiada the Priest gave to the centurions the spears, and the shields, and targets of king David, which he had consecrated in the house of our Lord.\n"
	"And he appointed all the people of them that held weapons on the right side of the temple, unto the left side of the temple, before the altar, and the temple, round about the king.\n"
	"And they brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and the testimony, and gave the law to be in his hand, and they made him king: Joiada also the high Priest, and his sons anointed him: and they wished him well, and said: God save the king.\n"
	"Which thing when Athalia had heard, to wit, the voice of them that ran and praised the king, she went in unto the people, into the temple of our Lord.\n"
	"And when she had seen the king standing upon the step in the entrance, and the Princes, and the companies about him, and all the people of the land rejoicing, and sounding with trumpets, and playing on instruments of diverse kind, & the voice of them that praised, she rent her garments, and said: Treason, treason.\n"
	"And Joiada the high Priest going forth to the centurions, and captains of the army, said to them: Bring her forth without the precinct of the temple, and let her be killed with the sword without. And the Priest commanded that she should not be killed in the house of our Lord.\n"
	"And they laid hands upon her neck: and when she was entered within the gate of the horses of the king's house, they killed her there.\n"
	"And Joiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they would be the people of our Lord.\n"

	"He appointed also porters in the gates of the house of our Lord, that the unclean in any thing should not enter in.\n"
	"And he took the centurions, and the most valiant men and Princes of the people, and all the common people of the land, and they made the king to go down from the house of our Lord, and to enter by the midst of the upper gate into the king's house, and placed him in the royal throne.\n"
	"And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet: moreover Athalia was slain with the sword.";

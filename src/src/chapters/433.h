	"And Raguel beholding Tobias, said to Anna his wife: How like is this young man to my sister's son!\n"
	"And when he had spoken these words, he said: Whence are ye young men our brethren?\n"
	"But they said: We are the tribe of Nephthali, of the captivity of Ninive.\n"
	"And Raguel said to them: Know you Tobias my brother? Who said: We know him.\n"
	"And when he spake much good of him, the Angel said to Raguel: Tobias, of whom thou askest is this man's father.\n"
	"And Raguel put forth himself, and with tears kissed him, and weeping upon his neck, said: Blessing have thou my son, because thou art the son of a good and most virtuous man.\n"
	"And Anna his wife, and Sara their daughter wept.\n"
	"And after they had talked, Raguel commanded a wether to be killed, and a banquet to be prepared, And when he desired them to sit down to dinner,\n"
	"Tobias said: I will not eat nor drink here this day, unless thou first assure my petition, and promise to give me Sara thy daughter.\n"
	"Which word Raguel hearing, was sore afraid, knowing what had chanced to those seven husbands, which went in unto her: and he began to fear lest perhaps, it might chance to him also in like manner: and when he doubted, and gave no answer to him demanding,\n"
	"the Angel said to him: Fear not to give her to this man, for to him fearing God is thy daughter due to be his wife: therefore another could not have her.\n"
	"Then said Raguel: I doubt not but God hath admitted my prayers and tears in his sight.\n"
	"And I believe that therefore he hath made you come to me, that this maid might be joined to her kindred, according to the law of Moyses: and now have no doubt but I will deliver her to thee.\n"
	"And taking his daughter by the right hand, gave it into the right hand of Tobias, saying: The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob be with you, and he join you together, and fulfill his blessing in you.\n"
	"And taking paper they made a writing of the marriage.\n"
	"And after these things they made merry, blessing God.\n"
	"And Raguel called to him Anna his wife, and commanded her to prepare another chamber.\n"
	"And she brought Sara her daughter in thither, and she wept.\n"
	"And she said to her: Be of good cheer my daughter, our Lord of heaven give thee joy for the tediousness which thou has suffered.";

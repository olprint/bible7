const char* chap1004 = "And the word of our Lord was made to Jonas the son of Amathi, saying:\n"
	"Arise, and go into Ninive the great city, and preach in it: because the malice thereof is ascended before me.\n"
	"And Jonas arose to fly into Tharsis from the face of our Lord, and he went down into Joppe, and found a ship going into Tharsis: and he gave the fare thereof, and went down into it, that he might go with them into Tharsis from the face of our Lord.\n"
	"But our Lord sent a great wind into the sea: and a great tempest was made in the sea, and the ship was in danger to be broken.\n"
	"And the mariners were afraid, and the men cried to their god: & they threw the vessels, that were in the ship, into the sea, that it might be lightened of them: & Jonas went down into the inner part of the ship, and slept a deep sleep.\n"
	"And the governer came to him & said to him: Why art thou oppressed with sleep? Rise, invocate thy God, if perhaps God will think of us, and we perish not.\n"
	"And every one said to his fellow: Come, and let us cast lots, and know why this evil is to us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.\n"
	"And they said to him: Tell us for whose cause this evil is to us, what is thy work? What is thy country? & whither goest thou? Or of what people art thou?\n"
	"And he said to them: I am an Hebrew, & the Lord God of heaven I fear, which made the sea and the dry land.\n"
	"And the men feared with greater fear, and they said to him: Why hast thou done this? (For the men knew that he fled from the face of our Lord: because he had told them.)\n"
	"And they said to him: What shall we do to thee, and the sea shall cease from us? Because the sea went, and swelled.\n"
	"And he said to them: Take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall cease from you: for I know that for me this great tempest is upon you.\n"
	"And the men rowed, to return to the land, and they were not able: because the sea went and swelled upon them.\n"
	"And they cried to our Lord, and said: We beseech thee o Lord, let us not perish in the life of this man, and give not upon us innocent blood: because thou o Lord, hast done as thou wouldest.\n"
	"And they took Jonas, and cast him into the sea: & the sea ceased from his rage.\n"
	"And the men feared our Lord with great fear, and immolated hosts to our Lord, and vowed vows.";

	"And he spake to the man, that was clothed with the linen garments, and said: Go in the midst of the wheels that are under the Cherubs, and fill thy hand with the coals of fire, that are between the Cherubs, and pour them out upon the city. And he went in, in my sight:\n"
	"& the Cherubs stood on the right hand of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.\n"
	"And the glory of our Lord was lifted up from above the Cherub to the threshold of the house: and the house was replenished with the cloud, & the court was replenished with the brightness of the glory of our Lord.\n"
	"And the sound of the wings of the Cherubs was heard even to the utter court, as it were the voice of God almighty speaking.\n"
	"And when he had commanded the man, that was clothed with the linen garments, saying: Take fire from the midst of the wheels, that are between the Cherubs: he being gone in stood beside the wheel.\n"
	"And a Cherub stretched out his hand from the midst of the Cherubs to the fire, that was between the Cherubs: & he took, & gave into his hands, that was clothed with the linen garments: who taking it went forth.\n"
	"And there appeared in the Cherubs the similitude of a man's hand under their wings.\n"
	"And I saw, & behold four wheels by the Cherubs: one wheel by one Cherub, & another wheel by one Cherub: & the form of the wheels was as it were the resemblance of the stone Chrysolithus:\n"
	"& their resemblance, one similitude to the four: as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel.\n"
	"And when they walked, they went into four parts: & they returned not walking: but to the place, whereunto that which was first declined, the rest also followed, neither did they turn.\n"
	"And all their body, & necks, & hands, & wings, and the circles were full of eyes, in the circuit of the four wheels.\n"
	"And these wheels he called voluble, myself hearing it.\n"
	"And one had four faces: one face, the face of a Cherub, and the second face, the face of a man: and in the third the face of a lion: and in the fourth the face of an eagle.\n"
	"And the Cherubs were lifted up: the same is the living creature, that I had seen by the river Chobar.\n"
	"And when the Cherubs walked, the wheels also went together by them: and when the Cherubs lifted up their wings, to be raised up from the earth, the wheels rested not, but also were beside them.\n"
	"Those standing, they stood: and with them lifted up they were lifted up. For the spirit of life was in them.\n"
	"And the glory of our Lord went forth from the threshold of the temple, and stood over the Cherubs.\n"
	"And the Cherubs lifting up their wings, were exalted from the earth before me: and they going forth, the wheels also followed: & it stood in the entry of the east gate of the house of our Lord: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.\n"
	"The same is the living creature, which I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chobar: an I understood that they were Cherubs.\n"
	"Four faces to one, and four wings to one: and the similitude of a man's hand under their wings.\n"
	"And the similitude of their faces, the same faces, which I had seen by the river Chobar, and the looks of them, and the sway of every one to go before his face.";

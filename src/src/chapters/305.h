const char* chap305 = "At that time Abia the son of Jeroboam was sick.\n"
	"And Jeroboam said to his wife: Arise, and change thy habit, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam, & go into Silo, where Ahias the Prophet is, which spake to me, that I should reign over this people.\n"
	"Take also in thy hand ten loaves, & cracknels, & a vessel of honey, & go to him: for he will shew thee what shall happen to this child.\n"
	"The wife of Jeroboam did as he had spoken: and rising up went into Silo, and came into the house of Ahias: but he could not see, because his eyes were dim for age.\n"
	"And our Lord said to Ahias: Behold the wife of Jeroboam cometh in, to consult thee concerning her son that is sick: thus and thus shalt thou speak to her. When she therefore entered in, and dissembled to be that she was,\n"
	"Ahias heard the sound of her feet entering in at the door, and said: Come in Jeroboam's wife: Why doest thou feign thyself to be another woman? But I am sent to thee a heavy messenger.\n"
	"Go, and tell Jeroboam: Thus saith our Lord the God of Israel: Because I have exalted thee out of the midst of the people, and made thee Prince over my people Israel,\n"
	"and have rent the Kingdom of the house of David, and given it to thee, and thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments; and followed me in all his heart, doing that which was well liked in my sight:\n"
	"but has wrought evil above all, that have been before thee, and hast made thee strange and molten gods, that thou mightest provoke me to anger, and hast rejected me behind thy back:\n"
	"therefore behold I will bring in evils upon the house of Jeroboam, and will strike of Jeroboam him that pisseth to the wall, and the inclosed, and the vilest in Israel: and I will cleanse the remains of the house of Jeroboam, as dung is wont to be cleansed till all be pure.\n"
	"They that shall die of Jeroboam in the city, them the dogs shall eat: and they that shall die in the field, them the fowls of the air shall devour: because our Lord hath spoken.\n"
	"Thou therefore arise, and go into thy house: and in the very entrance of thy feet into the city, the child shall die,\n"
	"& all Israel shall mourn for him, and shall bury him: for this only of Jeroboam shall be brought into the sepulchre, because upon him hath been found a good word from our Lord the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.\n"
	"And our Lord will appoint to himself a king over Israel, that shall strike the house of Jeroboam in this day, and in this time:\n"
	"and our Lord the God of Israel shall strike it, as a reed is wont to be moved in the water: and he shall pluck out Israel from this good country, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them over the River: because they have made to themselves groves, to provoke our Lord.\n"
	"And our Lord shall deliver Israel for the sins of Jeroboam, who hath sinned, and made Israel to sin.\n"
	"The wife therefore of Jeroboam arose, and departed, and came into Thersa: and when she entered the threshold of the house, the child died,\n"
	"and they buried him. And all Israel mourned for him according to the word of our Lord, which he spake in the hand of his servant Ahias the Prophet.\n"
	"But the rest of the words of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold they are written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel.\n"
	"And the days, that Jeroboam reigned, are two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers: and Nadab his son reigned for him.\n"
	"Moreover Roboam the son of Salomon reigned in Juda: one and forty years old was Roboam when he began to reign: seventeen years reigned he in Jerusalem the city, which our Lord chose to put his name there, of all the tribes of Israel. And his mother's name was Naama an Ammonite.\n"
	"And Judas did evil before our Lord, and provoked him above all things, that their fathers had done, in their sins which they sinned.\n"
	"For they also built them altars, & statues, & groves upon every high hill, and under every tree full of green leaves:\n"
	"yea and effeminates were in the land, and they did all the abominations of the gentiles, which our Lord destroyed before the face of the children of Israel.\n"
	"And in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Sesac the king of Aegypt came up into Jerusalem,\n"
	"and took the treasures of the house of our Lord, and the king's treasures, and all things he spoiled: the shields also of gold, which Salomon had made:\n"
	"for the which Roboam made brazen shields, and delivered them into the hand of the captains of shield-bearers, and of them that kept watch before the door of the king's house.\n"
	"And when the king went into the house of our Lord, they that had the office to go before, carried them: and afterward they recarried them to the armoury of the shield-bearers.\n"
	"And the rest of the words of Roboam, and all that he did, behold they are written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda.\n"
	"And there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam always.\n"
	"And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David: and his mother's name was Naama an Ammonite: and Abias his son reigned for him.";

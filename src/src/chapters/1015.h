	"God is jealous, & our Lord revenging, our Lord revenging, and having fury: our Lord revenging on his adversaries, and he is angry with his enemies.\n"
	"Our Lord is patient, and great of strength, and cleansing, he will not make innocent. Our Lord's ways in tempest, & whirlwind, & clouds, the dust of his feet.\n"
	"Rebuking the sea, & drying it up: & bringing all rivers to a desert. Basan is weakened & Carmel: & the flower of Libanus is faded.\n"

	"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that Evangelizeth, and preacheth peace: celebrate, o Juda, thy festivities, and render thy vows: because Belial shall no more add to pass through thee, he is wholly perished.";

const char* chap968 = "IT pleased Darius, and he appointed over the kingdom governers an hundred twenty to be in all his kingdom.\n"
	"And over them three princes, of whom Daniel was one: that the governers might render account to them, & the king might sustain no trouble.\n"
	"Daniel therefore passed all the princes, and governers: because there was the spirit of God more ample in him.\n"
	"Moreover the king thought to appoint him over all the kingdom, whereupon the princes, & the governers sought to find occasion against Daniel on the behalf of the king: and they could find no cause, nor suspicion, because he was faithful, and no fault, nor suspicion was found in him.\n"
	"Those men therefore said: We shall not find against this same Daniel any occasion, unless perhaps in the law of his God.\n"
	"Then the princes, and the governers by surreption suggested to the king, and spake thus unto him: King Darius, for ever live:\n"
	"All the princes of the kingdom, the magistrates, and governers, the senators and judges have taken counsel, that there go forth an imperial decree, and an edict: That every one, which shall ask any petition of whatsoever god, or man, until thirty days, but of thee o king, he be cast into the lake of lions.\n"
	"Now therefore o king confirm the sentence, and write the decree: that it may not be changed, which is decreed by the Medes and the Persians, nor be lawful for any man to transgress it.\n"
	"Moreover king Darius put forth the edict, and decreed it.\n"
	"Which when Daniel had perceived, that is to say, the law determined, he went into his house: and the windows being opened in his upper chamber, three times in a day toward Jerusalem bowed he his knees, and adored, and confessed before his God, as also he had accustomed to do before.\n"
	"Those men therefore searching curiously, found Daniel praying, and beseeching his God.\n"
	"And coming they spake to the king upon the edict: O king, hast thou not decreed, that every man which should ask any of the gods, & men until thirty days, but thyself o king, he should be cast into the lake of lions? To whom the king answering, said: The word is true according to the decree of the Medes, and Persians, which it is not lawful to transgress.\n"
	"Then they answering said before the king: Daniel of the children of the captivity of Juda, hath not cared for thy law, and for the edict, that thou madest: but three times in a day he prayeth with his prayer.\n"
	"Which word when the king had heard, he was strucken very sad: and for Daniel he set his heart to deliver him, and even until sun set he laboured to deliver him.\n"
	"But those men perceiving the king said to him: know thou o king, that the law of Medes and Persians is, that every decree, which the king hath determined, is not lawful to be changed.\n"
	"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the lake of lions. And the king said to Daniel: Thy God, whom thou doest worship always, he will deliver thee.\n"
	"And there was a stone brought, and laid upon the mouth of the lake: which the king sealed with his ring, and with the ring of his nobles, that nothing should be done against Daniel.\n"
	"And the king went into his house, and slept unsupped, and meats were not brought before him, moreover also sleep departed from him.\n"
	"Then the king rising in the very first break of day, went in haste to the lake of the lions:\n"
	"and approaching to the lake, cried on Daniel with a weeping voice, and spake unto him: Daniel servant of the living God, thy God whom thou servest always, hath he been able thinkest thou, to deliver thee from the lions?\n"
	"And Daniel answering the king said: King for ever live.\n"
	"My God hath sent his Angel, and hath shut up the mouths of the lions, and they have not hurt me: because before him justice hath been found in me: yea and before thee, o king, I have done no offence.\n"
	"Then was the king exceeding glad upon him, & he commanded Daniel to be brought out of the lake: and Daniel was brought out of the lake, and no hurt was found in him, because he believed his God.\n"
	"And by the king's commandment, those men were brought that had accused Daniel: and they were cast into the lake of the lions, themselves, and their children, and their wives: and they came not to the pavement of the lake, till the lions caught them, & brake all their bones in pieces.\n"
	"Then Darius the king wrote to all peoples, tribes, and tongues dwelling in the whole earth: PEACE be multiplied unto you.\n"
	"By me a decree is made, that in all mine empire, and my kingdom they dread and fear the God of Daniel. for he is the living and eternal God for ever: and his kingdom shall not be dissipated, & his power even for ever.\n"
	"He is the deliverer, and saviour, doing sign, & marvels in heaven, and in earth: who hath delivered Daniel out of the lake of the lions.\n"
	"Moreover Daniel continued unto the kingdom of Darius, and the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.";

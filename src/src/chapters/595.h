	"How long judge ye iniquity: and accept ye the persons of sinners.\n"
	"Judge ye for the needy and the pupil: justify ye the humble, and the poor.\n"
	"Take away the poor: and deliver the needy from the hand of the sinner.\n"
	"They knew not, neither did they understand, they walk in darkness: all the foundations of the earth shall be moved.\n"
	"I said: You are gods, and the sons of the highest all.\n"
	"But you shall die as men: and fall as one of the Princes.\n"

const char* chap515 = "Blessed is the man, that hath not gone in the counsel of the impious, & hath not stood in the way of sinners, and hath not sit in the chair of pestilence:\n"
	"But his will is in the way of our Lord, and in his law he will meditate day and night.\n"
	"And he shall be as a tree, that is planted nigh to the streams of waters, which shall give his fruit in his time. And his leaf shall not fall: and all things whatsoever he shall do, shall prosper.\n"
	"The impious not so, not so: but as dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth.\n"
	"Therefore the impious shall not rise again in judgment: nor sinners in the Council of the just.\n"
	"For our Lord knoweth the way of the just, and the way of the impious shall perish.";

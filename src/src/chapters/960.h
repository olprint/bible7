const char* chap960 = "Thus saith our Lord God: The gate of the inner court, which looketh to the East, shall be shut the six days, in which work is done: but in the Sabbath day it shall be opened, yea & in the day of the Calends it shall be opened.\n"
	"And the Prince shall enter in by the way of the entry of the gate from without, and he shall stand in the threshold of the gate: & the Priests shall make his holocaust, and his pacifics: and he shall adore upon the threshold of the gate, and shall go out: but the gate shall not be shut till evening.\n"
	"And the people of the land shall adore at the door of the gate in the Sabbaths, & in the Calends before our Lord.\n"
	"And this holocaust shall the Prince offer to our Lord: in the Sabbath day six lambs unspotted, & a ram unspotted.\n"
	"And sacrifice an ephi for a ram: but in the lambs the sacrifice that his hand shall give: and of oil an hin for every ephi.\n"
	"And in the day of the Calends a calf of the herd unspotted: and the six lambs, and the rams shall be unspotted.\n"
	"And an ephi for a calf, an ephi also for a ram shall he make sacrifice: but the lambs, as his hand shall find: & of oil an hin, for every ephi.\n"
	"And when the Prince is to go in, let him go in by the way of the entry of the gate, and by the same way let him go out.\n"
	"And when the people of the land shall enter in the sight of our Lord in the solemnities: he that goeth in by the North gate to adore, let him go out by the way of the South gate: moreover he that goeth in by the way of the South gate, let him go out by the way of the North gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate, whereby he entered, but at that over against it he shall go out.\n"
	"And the Prince in the midst of them with the goers in shall go in, & with the goers out shall go out.\n"
	"And in the fairs, and in the solemnities there shall be sacrifice an ephi for a calf, & an ephi for a ram: but of the lambs, there shall be sacrifice as his hand shall find: and of oil an hin for every ephi.\n"
	"But when the Prince shall make a voluntary holocaust, or voluntary pacifics to our Lord: to him the gate shall be opened, that looketh to the East, & he shall make his holocaust, & his pacifics, as it is wont to be done in the Sabbath day: and he shall go out, and the gate shall be shut after that he is gone forth.\n"
	"And a lamb of the same year unspotted, shall he make for holocaust daily to our Lord: always in the morning shall he make it.\n"
	"And he shall make sacrifice upon it morning by morning the sixth part of an ephi: & of oil the third part of an hin, that it may be mingled with the flour: a sacrifice to our Lord by ordinance, continual & everlasting.\n"
	"He shall make the lamb, & the sacrifice, & the oil morning by morning, an everlasting holocaust.\n"
	"Thus saith our Lord God: If the Prince shall give a gift to any of his sons: his inheritance shall be to his sons, they shall possess it by inheritance.\n"
	"But if he give a legacy of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of remission, & it shall return to the Prince: and his inheritance shall be to his sons.\n"
	"And the Prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by violence, & of their possession: & of his own possession he shall give the inheritance to his sons: that my people be not dispersed every one from his possession.\n"
	"And he brought me in by the entry, that was on the side of the gate, into the cells of the sanctuary to the Priests, which looked to the North. And there was a place bending to the West.\n"
	"And he said to me: This is the place where the Priests shall seethe that for sin, and that for offence: where they shall dress the sacrifice, that they bring it not out into the utter court, & the people be sanctified.\n"
	"And he brought me into the utter court, and he led me about by the four corners of the court: and behold there was a little court in the corner of the court, to every corner of the court a little court.\n"
	"In the four corners of the court were little courts disposed, of forty cubits in length, and thirty in breadth: the four were of one measure.\n"
	"And a wall round about compassing the four little courts: and there were kitchens builded under the porches round about.\n"
	"And he said to me: This is the house of kitchens wherein the ministers of the house of our Lord shall seethe the victims of the people.";

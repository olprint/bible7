	"And she conceived & bare a son in her old age, at the time that God had foretold her.\n"
	"And Abraham called the name of his son, which Sara bare him, Isaac:\n"
	"and he circumcised him the eighth day, as God had commanded him,\n"
	"when he was an hundred years old: for at this age of his father, was Isaac born.\n"
	"And Sara said: Laughter God hath made to me: whosoever shall hear of it, will laugh with me.\n"
	"And again she said: Who that shall hear of it would believe Abraham, that Sara gave suck to a son, which she bare him now being an old man?\n"
	"The child therefore grew and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast in the day of his weaning.\n"
	"And when Sara had seen the son of Agar the Aegyptian playing with Isaac her son, she said to Abraham:\n"
	"Cast out this handmaid, & her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not be heir with my son Isaac.\n"
	"Abraham took this grievously for his son.\n"
	"To whom God said: Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy, and for thy handmaid: all things that Sara shall say to thee, hear her voice: because in Isaac shall seed be called to thee.\n"
	"But the son also of the handmaid I will make into a great nation, because he is thy seed.\n"
	"Abraham therefore rose up in the morning, and taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and dismissed her. Who went away, and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee.\n"
	"And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there.\n"
	"And she went her way, and sat over against a great way off as far as a bow can cast, for she said: I will no see the child dying. And sitting over against, she lifted up her voice and wept.\n"
	"And God heard the voice of the boy: and an Angel of God called Agar from heaven, saying: What doest thou Agar? Fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is.\n"
	"Arise, take up the boy, & hold his hand; for into a great nation will I make him.\n"
	"And God opened her eyes: who seeing a well of water, went, and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink.\n"
	"And God was with him: who grew, and abode in the wilderness, and became a young man archer.\n"
	"And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Aegypt.\n"
	"The same time said Abimelech, and Phicol the General of his army, to Abraham: God is with thee in all things which thou doest.\n"
	"Swear therefore by God, not to hurt me, and my posterity, and my stock: but according to the mercy, that I have done thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger.\n"
	"And Abraham said: I will swear.\n"
	"And he rebuked Abimelech for the well of water, which his servants had taken away by force.\n"
	"And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this thing: yea and thyself didst not tell me, and I heard not of it but today.\n"
	"Abraham therefore took sheep and oxen, and gave to Abimelech: and both of them made a league.\n"
	"And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.\n"
	"To whom Abimelech said: What mean these seven ewe lambs, which thou hast made to stand apart?\n"
	"But he said: Seven ewe lambs shalt thou take at my hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I digged this well.\n"
	"Therefore was that place called Bersabee: because there both did swear.\n"
	"And they made a league for the well of oath.\n"
	"And Abimelech arose, and Phicol the General of his army, and they returned to the land of the Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee, and called there upon the name of our Lord God eternal.\n"
	"And he was a sojourner in the land of the Palestines many days.";

	"& saying: Do penance: for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\n"
	"For this is he that was spoken of by Esay the Prophet, saying: A voice of one crying in the desert, prepare ye the way of our Lord, make straight his paths.\n"
	"And the said John had his garment of camels' hair, and a girdle of a skin about his loins: and his meat was locusts & wild honey.\n"
	"Then went forth to him Jerusalem and all Jewry, and all the country about Jordan:\n"
	"& were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.\n"
	"And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his Baptism, he said to them. Ye viper's brood, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come?\n"
	"Yield therefore fruit worthy of penance.\n"
	"And delight not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our father. For I tell you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.\n"
	"For now the axe is put to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doth not yield good fruit, shall be cut down, & cast into the fire.\n"
	"I indeed baptize you in water unto penance, but he that shall come after me, is stronger than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear, he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost & fire.\n"
	"Whose fan is in his hand, and he shall clean purge his floor: and he will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.\n"
	"Then cometh JESUS from Galilee to Jordan, unto John, to be baptized of him.\n"
	"But John stayed him, saying: I ought to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?\n"
	"And JESUS answering, said to him: Suffer me for this time. For so it becometh us to fulfill all justice. Then he suffered him.\n"
	"And JESUS being baptized, forthwith came out of the water: and lo the Heavens were opened to him: & he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, & coming upon him.\n"
	"And behold a voice from Heaven saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.";

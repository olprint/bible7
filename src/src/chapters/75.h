	"Onyx stones, and precious stones to adorn the ephod, and rationale.\n"
	"And they shall make me a sanctuary, and I will dwell in the midst of them:\n"
	"according to all the similitude of the tabernacle which I will shew thee, & of all the vessels to the service thereof: and thus you shall make it:\n"
	"Frame an ark of the wood setim, the length whereof shall have two cubits & an half: the breadth, a cubit & an half: the height, likewise a cubit & an half.\n"

	"& four golden rings, which thou shalt put at the four corners of the ark: let two rings be on the one side, & two on the other.\n"

	"wherein thou shalt put the testimony that I will give thee.\n"
	"Thence will I command, and will speak to thee over the propitiatory & from the midst of the two Cherubims which shall be upon the ark of testimony, all things which I will command the children of Israel by thee.\n"
	"Thou shalt make a table also of the wood setim, having two cubits in length, and in breadth a cubit, & in height a cubit and an half.\n"

	"and to the ledge itself a crown interpolished, four fingers high: and upon the same, another golden crown.\n"
	"Thou shalt prepare also four golden rings, and shalt put them in the four corners of the same table at every foot.\n"
	"Under the crown shall the golden rings be, that the bars may be put through them, and the table may be carried.\n"

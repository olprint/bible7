const char* chap399 = "After which things, and this manner of truth, came Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians, and entering into Juda, besieged the fenced cities, desirous to take them.\n"
	"Which when Ezechias had seen, to wit, that Sennacherib was come, and the whole force of the battle to be turned against Jerusalem,\n"
	"taking counsel with the Princes, and the most valiant men, to stop up the heads of the fountains, that were without the city: and the sentence of them all decreeing this,\n"
	"he gathered a very great multitude, & they stopped up all the fountains, and the river that ran in the midst of the land, saying: Lest the kings of the Assyrians come, and find aboundance of waters.\n"
	"He built also doing industriously every wall that had been destroyed, and built towers upon them, & another wall without: and he repaired Mello in the city of David, and made armour and shields of all sorts:\n"
	"And he appointed Princes of warriors in the army: and he called them all together in the street of the gate of the city, and spake to their heart, saying:\n"
	"Do manfully, & take courage: fear not, neither dread ye the king of the Assyrians, and all the multitude, that is with him: for there are many more with us, than with him.\n"
	"For with him is an arm of flesh: with us the Lord our God, which is our helper, and fighteth for us. And the people was encouraged with these manner of words of Ezechias the king of Juda.\n"
	"Which things after they were done, Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians sent his servants to Jerusalem (for himself with all his army besieged Lachis) to Ezechias the king of Juda, and to all the people, that was in the city, saying:\n"
	"Thus saith Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians: In whom having affiance, do you sit besieged in Jerusalem?\n"
	"Hath Ezechias deceived you, to deliver you to death in hunger and thirst, affirming that the Lord your God can deliver you from the hand of the king of the Assyrians?\n"
	"Why, is not this Ezechias, that hath destroyed his excelses, and altars, and hath commanded Juda and Jerusalem, saying: Before one altar you shall adore, and on it you shall burn incense?\n"
	"Are you ignorant what things I have done, and my fathers to all the peoples of the lands? Have the gods of nations, and of all lands been able to deliver their country out of my hand?\n"
	"Who is there of all the gods of the nations, which my fathers wasted, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God also can deliver you out of this hand?\n"
	"Let not therefore Ezechias deceive you, nor delude you with vain persuasion, neither believe ye him. For if no god of all nations & Kingdoms could deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers, consequently neither shall your God be able to deliver you out of my hand.\n"
	"Yea & many other things did his servants speak against our Lord God, and against Ezechias his servant.\n"
	"Letters also he wrote full of blasphemy against our Lord the God of Israel, and he spake against him: as the gods of their nations could not deliver their people out of my hand, so the God also of Ezechias cannot deliver his people out of this hand.\n"
	"Moreover also with a loud cry, in the Jews' tongue, he sounded against the people that sat on the walls of Jerusalem, that he might terrify them, and take the city.\n"
	"And he spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the peoples of the earth, the works of men's hands.\n"
	"Ezechias therefore the king, and Isaias the Prophet the son of Amos, prayed against this blasphemy, and cried out even to heaven.\n"
	"And our Lord sent an Angel, which struck every strong man, and warrior, and Prince of the army of the king of the Assyrians: and he returned with ignominy into his country. And when he was entered into the house of his god, his sons that were come forth of his womb, slew him with the sword.\n"
	"And our Lord saved Ezechias and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of the hand of Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians, and out of the hand of all, and gave them rest round about.\n"
	"Many also brought hosts, and sacrifices to our Lord into Jerusalem, and gifts to Ezechias the king of Juda: who was exalted after these things before all nations.\n"
	"In those days Ezechias was sick even to death, and he prayed our Lord: and he heard him, and gave him a sign.\n"
	"But not according to the benefits which he received, did he recompense, because his heart was elevated: & wrath came against him, and against Juda and Jerusalem.\n"
	"And he was humbled afterward, because his heart had been exalted, both he & the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and therefore the wrath of our Lord came not upon them in the days of Ezechias.\n"
	"And Ezechias was rich & glorious exceedingly, & gathered to himself great treasures of silver and of gold, and of precious stone, of spices, & of armour of all kind, and of vessels of great price.\n"
	"Storehouses also of corn, of wine, and of oil, and stalls of all beasts, and folds of cattle,\n"
	"and six cities he built to himself: for he had flocks of sheep, & of herds innumerable, because our Lord had given him substance exceeding much.\n"
	"The same is Ezechias, that stopped the upper fountain of the waters of Gihon, and turned them away underneath toward the West of the City of David: in all his works he did prosperously what he would.\n"
	"But yet in the embassy of the Princes of Babylon, that were sent to him, to ask of the wonder, that had chanced upon the earth, God left him that he might be tempted, and all things might be made known, that were in his heart.\n"
	"But the rest of the words of Ezechias, and of his mercies, are written in the vision of Isaias the son of Amos the Prophet, and in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.\n"
	"And Ezechias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chief sepulchres of the children of David: and all Juda celebrated his funerals, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and Manasses his son reigned for him.";

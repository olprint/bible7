	"And he called him, and said to him: What hear I this of thee? Render account of thy bailiffship: for now thou canst no more be bailiff.\n"
	"And the bailiff said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the bailiffship? Dig I am not able, to beg I am ashamed.\n"
	"I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the bailiffship, they may receive me into their houses.\n"

	"And if you have not been faithful in other men's, that which is yours, who will give you?\n"

	"And there was a certain beggar called Lazarus, that lay at his gate, full of sores:\n"
	"desiring to be filled of the crumbs, that fell from the rich man's table, but the dogs also came, and licked his sores.\n"
	"And it came to pass that the beggar died, and was carried of the Angels into Abraham's bosom. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell.\n"
	"And lifting up his eyes, when he was in torments, he saw Abraham a far off, and Lazarus in his bosom:\n"
	"and he crying said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger into water for to cool my tongue, because I am tormented in this flame.\n"

	"But he said: No, father Abraham, but if some man shall go from the dead to them, they will do penance.\n"
	"And he said to him: If they hear not Moyses and the Prophets, neither if one shall rise again from the dead, will they believe.";

const char* chap551 = "A Psalm of David, in recordation of the sabbath.\n"
	"Lord rebuke me not in thy fury: nor chastise me in wrath.\n"
	"Because thy arrows are fast sticked in me: and thou hast fastened thy hand upon me.\n"
	"There is no health in my flesh at the face of thy wrath: my bones have no peace at the face of my sins.\n"
	"Because mine iniquities are gone over my head: and as a heavy burden are become heavy upon me.\n"
	"My scars are putrefied and corrupted, because of my foolishness.\n"
	"I am become miserable, and am made crooked even to the end: I went sorrowful all the day.\n"
	"Because my loins are filled with illusions: and there is no health in my flesh.\n"
	"I am afflicted and am humbled exceedingly: I roared for the groaning of my heart.\n"
	"Lord before thee is all my desire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.\n"
	"My heart is troubled, my strength hath forsaken me: and the light of mine eyes, and the same is not with me.\n"
	"My friends, and my neighbours have approached, & stood against me. And they that were near me, stood far off:\n"
	"and they did violence which sought my soul. And they that sought me evils spake vanities: and meditated guiles all the day.\n"
	"But I as one deaf did not hear: and as one dumb not opening his mouth.\n"
	"And I became as a man not hearing: and not having reproofs in his mouth.\n"
	"Because in thee, o Lord have I hoped, thou wilt hear me, o Lord my God.\n"
	"Because I said: Lest sometime mine enemies rejoice over me, and whilst my feet are moved, they spake great things upon me.\n"
	"Because I am ready for scourges: and my sorrow is in my sight always:\n"
	"Because I will declare my iniquity: and I will think for my sin.\n"
	"But mine enemies live, and are confirmed over me: and they are multiplied that hate me unjustly.\n"
	"They that repay evil things for good, detracted from me: because I followed goodness.\n"
	"Forsake me not, o Lord my God, depart not from me.\n"
	"Attend unto my help, o Lord the God of my salvation.";

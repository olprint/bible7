	"Speak to the children of Israel, and take a rod of every one of their kindreds, of all the Princes of their tribes, twelve rods, and the name of every one thou shalt write upon his rod.\n"
	"And the name of Aaron shall be in the tribe of Levi, and one rod shall contain all their families:\n"
	"and thou shalt lay them in the tabernacle of covenant before the testimony, where I will speak to thee.\n"
	"Whomsoever of these I shall choose, his rod shall blossom: and I shall stay from me the grudgings of the children of Israel, wherewith they murmur against you.\n"
	"And Moyses spake to the children of Israel: and all the Princes gave him rods by every tribe: and they were twelve rods besides Aaron's rod.\n"

	"returning the day following he found that Aaron's rod in the house of Levi was budded: and the buds thereof swelling, the blossoms were shot forth, which spreading the leaves; were fashioned into almonds.\n"
	"Moyses therefore brought forth all the rods from the sight of our Lord to all the children of Israel, and they saw and every one received their rods.\n"
	"And our Lord said to Moyses: Carry back Aaron's rod into the tabernacle of testimony, that it may be kept there for a sign of the rebellious children of Israel, and let their complaints cease from me, lest they die.\n"
	"And Moyses did as our Lord had commanded.\n"
	"And the children of Israel said to Moyses: Behold we are consumed, we are all perished.\n"
	"Whosoever approacheth to the tabernacle of our Lord, he dieth. Are we all to be destroyed unto utter consumption?";

const char* chap833 = "Hear ye these things o house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come out of the waters of Juda, which swear in the name of our Lord, and are mindful of the God of Israel not in truth, nor in justice.\n"
	"For they are called of the holy city, and are established upon the God of Israel: the Lord of hosts is his name.\n"
	"The former things of old I have declared, & they proceeded out of my mouth, and I have made them to be heard: Suddenly I have wrought, and they came.\n"
	"For I knew that thou art stubborn, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy forehead of brass.\n"
	"I foretold thee of old: before they came I told thee, lest perhaps thou shouldst say: My idols have done these things, & my sculptiles & moltens have commanded these things.\n"
	"See all the things which thou hast heard: but have you declared them? I have made thee know new things of old, and the things are kept which thou knowest not:\n"
	"now they are created, and not of old: and before the day, and thou heardest them not, lest perhaps thou mightest say: Behold I knew them.\n"
	"Thou hast neither heard, nor known, neither was thine ear opened of old. For I know that transgressing thou wilt transgress, and I have called thee a transgressor from the womb.\n"
	"For my name's sake I will make my fury far off: and for my praise I will bridle thee, that thou perish not.\n"
	"Behold I have fined thee, but not as silver, I have chosen thee in the furnace of poverty.\n"
	"For myself, for myself will I do it, that I be not blasphemed: and I will not give my glory to another.\n"
	"Hear me, o Jacob, and thou Israel whom I call: I^ the same, I^ the first, & I^ the last.\n"
	"My hand also hath founded the earth, and my right hand hath measured the heavens: I shall call them, & they shall stand together.\n"
	"Assemble ye together all you, & hear: which of them hath shewed these things? The Lord hath loved him, he will do his will in Babylon, and his arm in the Chaldees.\n"
	"I, even I have spoken, and called him: I have brought him, and his way is directed.\n"
	"Come ye to me, and hear this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning, from the time before it was done I was there, and now the Lord God hath sent me, and his spirit.\n"
	"Thus saith our Lord thy Redeemer, the holy one of Israel: I^ the Lord thy God that teach thee profitable things, that govern thee in the way that thou walkest.\n"
	"I would thou hadst attended to my commandments: thy peace had been as a flood, and thy justice as the waves of the sea.\n"
	"And thy seed had been as the sand, and the stock of thy womb as the gravel stones thereof: his name had not perished, neither had it been destroyed from before my face.\n"
	"Come forth out of Babylon, fly from the Chaldees, shew it forth in the voice of exultation: make this to be heard, and speak it out even to the ends of the earth. Say: Our Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.\n"
	"They thirsted not in the desert, when he brought them forth: water out of the rock he brought forth to them, and he clove the rocks, and there flowed waters.\n"
	"There is no peace to the impious, saith our Lord.";

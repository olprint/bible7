const char* chap57 = "And our Lord said to Moyses: Behold I have appointed thee the God of Pharao: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.\n"
	"Thou shalt speak to him all things that I command thee: and he shall speak to Pharao that he dismiss the children of Israel out of his land.\n"
	"But I will indurate his heart, and will multiply my signs and wonders in the Land of Aegypt,\n"
	"and he will not hear you: and I will put in my hand upon Aegypt, and will bring forth my army and people the children of Israel out of the Land of Aegypt, by very great judgments.\n"
	"And the Aegyptians shall know that I am the Lord, which have stretched forth my hand upon Aegypt, and have brought forth the children of Israel out of the midst of them.\n"
	"Therefore Moyses and Aaron did as our Lord had commanded: so did they.\n"
	"And Moyses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty three, when they spake to Pharao.\n"
	"And our Lord said to Moyses and Aaron:\n"
	"When Pharao shall say unto you, Shew signs, thou shalt say to Aaron: Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharao, and it shall be turned into a serpent.\n"
	"Therefore Moyses and Aaron going in unto Pharao, did as our Lord had commanded. And Aaron took the rod before Pharao and his servants, the which was turned into a serpent.\n"
	"And Pharao called the wise men and the enchanters: and they also by Aegyptian enchantments and certain secrecies did in like manner.\n"
	"And every one did cast forth their rods, the which were turned into dragons: but Aaron's rod devoured their rods.\n"
	"And Pharao's heart was indurate, and he heard them not, as our Lord had commanded.\n"
	"And our Lord said to Moyses: Pharao's heart is aggravated, he will not dismiss the people.\n"
	"Go to him in the morning, behold he will go forth to the waters: and thou shalt stand to meet him upon the bank of the river: and the rod that was turned into a dragon, thou shalt take in thy hand.\n"
	"And thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews sent me to thee, saying: Dismiss my people to sacrifice unto me in the desert: and until this present thou wouldst not hear.\n"
	"This therefore saith our Lord: In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord: behold I will strike with the rod that is in my hand, the water of the river, and it shall be turned into blood.\n"
	"The fishes also, that are in the river, shall die, and the waters shall putrefy, and the Aegyptians shall be afflicted drinking the water of the river.\n"
	"Our Lord also said to Moyses: Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand upon the waters of Aegypt, and upon their floods, and rivers, and pools, and all the lakes of waters, that they may be turned into blood: and be there blood in all the Land of Aegypt, as well in the vessels of wood as of stone.\n"
	"And Moyses and Aaron did as our Lord had commanded: and lifting up the rod he struck the water of the river before Pharao and his servants: which was turned into blood.\n"
	"And the fishes that were in the river died, and the river putrefied, and the Aegyptians could not drink the water of the river, and there was blood in the whole land of Aegypt.\n"
	"And the enchanters of the Aegyptians with their enchantments did in like manner and Pharao's heart was indurate, neither did he hear them, as our Lord had commanded.\n"
	"And he turned away himself, and went into his house, neither did he yet set his heart to it this time also.\n"
	"And all the Aegyptians digged round about the river for water to drink: for they could not drink of the water of the river.\n"
	"And seven days were fully ended, after that our Lord struck the river.";

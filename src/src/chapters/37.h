const char* chap37 = "And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan, wherein his father sojourned.\n"
	"And these are his generations: Joseph when he was sixteen years old, fed the flock with his brethren being yet a boy: and he was with the sons of Bala and Zelpha his father's wives: and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.\n"
	"And Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had begotten him in his old age and he made him a coat of diverse colours.\n"
	"And his brethren seeing that he was loved of his father more than all his sons, they hated him, neither could they speak any thing to him peaceably.\n"
	"It chanced also that he reported to his brethren a dream that he had seen, which occasion was the seed of great hatred.\n"
	"And he said to them: hear my dream which I have seen:\n"
	"I thought we bound sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, and stood, and your sheaves standing about did adore my sheaf.\n"
	"His brethren answered: What? Shalt thou be our king? Or shall we be subject to thy dominion? This occasion of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to the envy and hatred.\n"
	"He saw also another dream, which telling his brethren, he said: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars adore me.\n"
	"Which when he had reported to his father and brethren, his father rebuked him, and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast seen? Why, shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren adore thee upon the earth?\n"
	"His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the thing with himself.\n"
	"And when his brethren abode in Sichem feeding their father's flocks,\n"
	"Israel said to him: Thy brethren feed sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them. Who answering,\n"
	"I am ready; he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren and the sheep, and bring me word again what they do. Being sent therefore from the Vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem:\n"
	"and a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought.\n"
	"But he answered: I seek my brethren, shew me where they feed the flocks.\n"
	"And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go into Dothain. Joseph therefore went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.\n"
	"Who when they had seen him a far off, before he came nigh them, they devised to kill him:\n"
	"and spake among themselves: Behold the dreamer cometh,\n"
	"come, let us kill him, and cast him into an old cistern: and we will say a naughty wild beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his dreams do profit him.\n"
	"And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, and said:\n"
	"Do not take away his life, neither shed ye blood: but cast him into this cistern that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: and he said this, desirous to deliver him out of their hands, and to restore him to his father.\n"
	"As soon therefore as he came unto his brethren, forthwith they stripped him out of his side coat, and of diverse colours,\n"
	"and cast him into the old cistern, that had not water.\n"
	"And sitting to eat bread, they saw Ismaelites^ wayfaring men coming from Galaad, and their camels carrying spices, and rosen, and myrrh into Aegypt.\n"
	"Judas therefore said to his brethren: What availeth it us if we kill our brother, and conceal his blood?\n"
	"It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not polluted: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren assented to his words.\n"
	"And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drawing him out of the cistern, sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver, who brought him into Aegypt.\n"
	"An Ruben returning to the cistern, findeth not the boy:\n"
	"and renting his garments went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear, and whither shall I go?\n"
	"And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid which they had killed,\n"
	"sending some that should carry it to their father, and should say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or no.\n"
	"Which when the father acknowledged, he said: It is my son's coat, a naughty wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph.\n"
	"And tearing his garments, did on sackcloth, mourning his son a great time.\n"
	"And all his children being gathered together to assuage their father's sorrow, he would not take comfort, but said: I will descend unto my son into hell, mourning. And whilst he persevered in weeping,\n"
	"the Madianites sold Joseph in Aegypt to Putiphar an Eunuch of Pharao's, master of the soldiers.";

	"And he called all the ancients, & all the captains, and his men of war, and communicated with them the secret of his counsel:\n"
	"& he said that his cogitation was upon that, to subdue all the earth to his empire.\n"
	"Which saying when it had pleased them all, Nabuchodonosor the king called Holofernes the General of his wars,\n"
	"and said to him: Go forth against every Kingdom of the west, and against them especially, that contemned my commandment.\n"
	"Thine eye shall spare no Kingdom, and every fenced city thou shalt subdue to me.\n"
	"Then Holofernes called the captains and magistrates of the power of the Assyrians: and he mustered men for the expedition, as the king commanded him, an hundred twenty thousand fighting men on foot, and twelve thousand archers horsemen.\n"
	"And he made all his expedition to go before in a multitude of innumerable camels, with those things that might suffice the armies aboundantly, herds of oxen also, & flocks of sheep, which had no number.\n"
	"He appointed corn to be prepared out of all Syria in his passage.\n"
	"But gold & silver he took out of the king's house exceeding much.\n"
	"And he went forth and all the army, with the chariots, & horsemen, & the archers, which covered the face of the earth as locusts.\n"
	"And when he had passed through the coasts of the Assyrians, he came to the great mountains of Ange, which are on the left hand of Cilicia: and he went up into all their castles, and won every fortress.\n"
	"And he brake down the renowned city of Melothus, and spoiled all the children of Tharsis, and the children of Ismael, which were against the face of the desert, and on the south of the land of Cellon.\n"
	"And he passed over Euphrates, & came into Mesopotamia: & he brake all the high cities, that were there, from the torrent of Mambre, till ye come to the sea:\n"
	"and he took the borders thereof, from Cilicia unto the coasts of Japheth, which are toward the south.\n"
	"And he carried away all the children of Madian, & spoiled all their riches, and all that resisted him he slew in the edge of the sword.\n"
	"And after these things he went down into the fields of Damascus in the days of harvest, and he set all the corn on fire, & he made all the trees and vineyards to be cut down;\n"
	"and the fear of him fell upon all the inhabitants of the land.";

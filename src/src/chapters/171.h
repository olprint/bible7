const char* chap171 = "The Priests and Levites, and all that are of the same tribe, shall have no part nor inheritance with the rest of Israel, because they shall eat the sacrifices of our Lord, and his oblations,\n"
	"and nothing else shall they receive of the possession of their brethren: for our Lord himself is their inheritance, as he hath spoken to them.\n"
	"This shall be the right of the Priests from the people, and from them that offer victims: whether they immolate oxe, or sheep, they shall give to the Priest the shoulder and the maw:\n"
	"the first fruits of corn, of wine, and oil, and a part of the wool of their sheep-shearing.\n"
	"For him hath our Lord chosen of all thy tribes, that he might stand and minister to our Lord, he and his sons for ever.\n"
	"If a Levite go out of one of thy cities of all Israel in the which he dwelleth, and would come desiring the place which our Lord shall choose,\n"
	"he shall minister in the name of our Lord his God, as all his brethren the Levites, that shall stand at that time before our Lord.\n"
	"He shall receive the same portion of meats that the rest do: beside that, which in his own city is due to him by succession from his fathers.\n"
	"When thou art entered the Land, which our Lord thy God shall give thee, beware thou be not willing to imitate the abominations of those nations.\n"
	"Neither let there be found in thee any that shall expiate his son, or daughter, making them to pass through the fire: or that demandeth of soothsayers, and observeth dreams and divinations, neither let there be a sorcerer,\n"
	"nor enchanter, nor that consulteth with python, or diviners, and seeketh the truth of the dead.\n"
	"For all these things our Lord abhorreth, and for these abominations will he destroy them at thy entering in.\n"
	"Thou shalt be perfect & without spot with our Lord thy God.\n"
	"These nations, whose land thou shalt possess, hear soothsayers, and diviners: but thou art otherwise instructed of our Lord thy God.\n"
	"A PROPHET of thy nation & of thy brethren like unto me, will our Lord thy God raise up to thee: him thou shalt hear,\n"
	"as thou didst request of our Lord thy God in Horeb, when the assembly was gathered, and saidst: I will no more hear the voice of our Lord my God, and this exceeding great fire I will see no more, lest I die.\n"
	"And our Lord said to me: They have spoken all things well.\n"
	"A Prophet will I raise up to them out of the midst of their brethren like to thee: and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak all things that I shall command him.\n"
	"But he that will not hear his words, which he shall speak in my name, I will be the revenger.\n"
	"And the Prophet that being depraved with arrogancy will speak in my name, the things that I did not command him to say, or in the name of strange gods, shall be slain.\n"
	"And if in secret cogitation thou answer: How shall I understand the word, that our Lord spake not?\n"
	"This sign thou shalt have: That which the same Prophet foretelleth, in the name of the Lord, & cometh not to pass: that^ our Lord hath not spoken, but by the arrogancy of his mind the Prophet hath forged it: and therefore thou shalt not fear him.";

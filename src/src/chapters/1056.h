const char* chap1056 = "And Simon heard that Tryphon gathered a very great army, to come into the land of Juda, and to destroy it.\n"
	"Seeing that the people was in dread, and in fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and assembled the people:\n"
	"and exhorting he said: You know what great battles I and my brethren, and the house of my father have made for the laws, and the holies, and the distresses that we have seen:\n"
	"by reason of these are all my brethren perished for Israel, and I only am left.\n"
	"And now let it not fall to me to spare my life in all time of tribulation: for I am not better than my brethren.\n"
	"I will avenge therefore my nation and the holies, our children also, and wives: because all the heathen are gathered together to destroy us of enmity.\n"
	"And the spirit of the people was kindled as soon as they heard these words:\n"
	"and they answered with a loud voice, saying: Thou art our captain in the place of Judas, and Jonathas thy brother:\n"
	"fight thou our battle, and we will do all things whatsoever thou shalt say to us.\n"
	"And gathering together all the men of war, he hastened to finish all the walls of Jerusalem, and fortified it round about.\n"
	"And he sent Jonathas the son of Absalom, and with him a new army into Joppe, and they that were in the castle being cast out, he remained there.\n"
	"And Tryphon removed from Ptolemais with a great army, to come into the land of Juda, and Jonathas with him in ward.\n"
	"But Simon pitched in Addus against the face of the plain.\n"
	"And as Tryphon understood that Simon was risen in the place of his brother Jonathas: and that he would join battle with him, he sent legates to him,\n"
	"saying: For the silver, that thy brother Jonathas owed in the king's account, for the affairs which he had, we have stayed him.\n"
	"And now send an hundred talents of silver, and his two sons for hostages, that being dismissed he fly not from us, and we will release him.\n"
	"And Simon knew that with guile he spake with him, nevertheless he commanded the silver, and the children to be given: lest he should get great enmity with the people of Israel, saying:\n"
	"Because he sent not the silver, and the children, therefore is he perished.\n"
	"And he sent the children, and the hundred talents: and he lied, and dismissed not Jonathas.\n"
	"And after these things came Tryphon within the country, to destroy it, and they compassed by the way that leadeth to Addar, and Simon, & his camp marched into every place whither soever they went.\n"
	"And they that were in the castle sent legates to Tryphon, that he should hasten to come through the desert, and should send them victuals.\n"
	"And Tryphon prepared all the horsemen to come that night: but there was an exceeding great snow, and he came not into the country of Galaad.\n"
	"And when he had approached to Bascama, he slew Jonathas and his sons there.\n"
	"And Tryphon returned, and went into his country.\n"
	"And Simon sent and took the bones of Jonathas his brother, and buried them in Modin the city of his fathers.\n"
	"And all Israel lamented him with great lamentation: and they mourned for him many days.\n"
	"And Simon built over the sepulchre of his father and of his brethren a building high to behold, of stone polished behind and before:\n"
	"and he erected seven spires one against one, to his father and mother, and to his four brethren:\n"
	"and about these he set great pillars: and upon the pillars armour for an eternal memory: and by the armour ships graven, which might be seen of all that sailed the sea.\n"
	"This is the sepulchre, that he made in Modin even until this day.\n"
	"But Tryphon when he journeyed with Antiochus the king, being but a young man, by guile he slew him.\n"
	"And he reigned in his place, & put the crown of Asia upon himself, and made a great plague in the land.\n"
	"And Simon built the fortresses of Jurie, fortifying them with high towers, & great walls, and gates, and locks: and he put victuals in the fortresses.\n"
	"And Simon chose men & sent to Demetrius the king, that he would make a release to the country: because all Tryphon's acts had been done by spoil.\n"
	"And Demetrius the king according to these words answered him, and wrote an epistle in this manner:\n"
	"KING Demetrius to Simon the High-Priest, and the friend of kings, and to the ancients, and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.\n"
	"The crown of gold, and the bahem, which you sent, we have received: and we are ready to make with you great peace, and to write to the king's chief officers to release you the things that we have released.\n"
	"For whatsoever things we have decreed unto you, stand in force. The holds that you have built, let them be to you.\n"
	"We remit also the ignorances, and offences even until this day, and the crown which you owed: and if any other thing was tributary in Jerusalem, now let it not be tributary.\n"
	"And if any of you be fit to be enrolled among ours, let them be enrolled and let there be peace between us.\n"
	"In the year an hundreth seventy was the yoke of the Gentiles taken away from Israel.\n"
	"And the people of Israel began to write in the tables, and public instruments. The first year under Simon the High-Priest, the great Duke, and the Prince of the Jews:\n"
	"In these days Simon approached to Gaza, and compassed it with camps, and he made engines, and set them to the city, and he struck one tower, and took it.\n"
	"And they that were within the engine, brake out into the city: and there was made a great stir in the city.\n"
	"And they that were in the city went up with their wives and children upon the wall their coats rent, and they cried with a loud voice, desiring of Simon that the right hands might be given them,\n"
	"and they said: Requite us not according to our malices, but according to thy mercies.\n"
	"And Simon yielding destroyed them not: but yet he cast them out of the city, and cleansed the houses, wherein there had been idols, and then he entered into it with hymns blessing our Lord:\n"
	"and all filthiness being cast out of it, he placed in it men that should do the law: and he fortified it, and made it his habitation.\n"
	"But they that were in the castle of Jerusalem, were prohibited to go out and to come into the country, and to buy and sell: and they were exceeding hungry, and many of them perished for famine,\n"
	"and they cried to Simon to receive the right hands, and he gave it them: and he cast them out from thence, and cleansed the castle from the contaminations:\n"
	"and they entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month, the year an hundreth seventy one, with praise, and boughs of palm trees, and harps, and cymbals, and nables, and hymns, and canticles, because the great enemy was destroyed out of Israel.\n"
	"And he ordained that every year these days should be kept with gladness.\n"
	"And he fortified the mount of the temple, that was by the castle, and he dwelt there himself, & they that were with him.\n"
	"And Simon saw John his son, that he was a valiant man of war: and he made him captain of all the hosts: and he dwelt in Gazara.";

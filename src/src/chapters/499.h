	"God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment, and the Omnipotent, which hath brought my soul to bitterness.\n"
	"That as long as breath remaineth in me, and the spirit of God in my nostrils,\n"
	"My lips shall not speak iniquity, neither shall my tongue meditate lying.\n"
	"God forbid that I should judge you to be just: till I fail, I will not depart from mine innocency.\n"
	"My justification which I have begun to hold, I will not forsake: for my heart doth not reprehend me in all my life.\n"
	"Let mine enemy be as the impious, and mine adversary as the wicked one.\n"
	"For what is the hypocrite's hope, if covetously he take by violence, and God deliver not his soul?\n"
	"Will God hear his cry, when distress shall come upon him?\n"
	"Or can he be delighted in the Omnipotent, and invocate God at all time?\n"
	"I will teach you by the hand of God, what the Omnipotent hath, neither will I hide it.\n"
	"Lo, you do all know, and why speak you vain things without cause?\n"
	"This is the portion of an impious man with God, and inheritance of the violent, which they shall receive of the Omnipotent.\n"
	"If his children be multiplied, they shall be in the sword, & his nephews shall not be filled with bread.\n"
	"They that shall be left of him, shall be buried in death, and his widows shall not weep.\n"
	"If he shall heap together silver as earth, and as clay shall prepare garments:\n"
	"He shall prepare indeed, but the just man shall be clothed with them: and the innocent shall divide the silver.\n"
	"He hath built his house as a moth, and as a keeper hath he made a bower.\n"
	"The rich man when he shall sleep shall take away nothing with him: he shall open his eyes, and find nothing.\n"
	"Poverty as water shall apprehend him, in the night a tempest shall oppress him.\n"
	"The burning wind shall take him up, and carry him away, and as a whirlwind shall pull him violently out of his place.\n"
	"And he shall cast upon him, and shall not spare: out of his hand flying he shall fly.\n"
	"He shall clasp his hands upon him, and shall hiss upon him, beholding his place.";

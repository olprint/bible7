	"and the residue of kingdoms, and isles that some time had resisted them, they spoiled, and brought under their power.\n"
	"But with their friends, and those that rested in them, they kept amity, and obtained the kingdoms, that were next, and that were far off: that whosoever heard their name, feared them.\n"
	"But such as they would help to reign, those reigned: and whom they would, they deposed from the kingdom: and they were exalted exceedingly.\n"

	"BE IT WELL TO THE ROMANS, and to the nation of the Jews by sea, and by land for ever: and sword and enemy be far from them.\n"

	"the nation of the Jews shall give aid, according as the time shall appoint, with full heart:\n"
	"and to them fighting, they shall not give nor allow wheat, armour, money, ships, as it hath pleased the Romans: & they shall keep their charge, taking nothing of them.\n"
	"In like manner also & if war shall happen first to the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall help with all their heart, according as the time shall permit them:\n"

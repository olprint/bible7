const char* chap603 = "A prayer of Moyses the man of God. Lord, thou art made a refuge for us: from generation unto generation.\n"
	"Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world formed, from everlasting even unto everlasting thou art God.\n"
	"Turn not away man into humiliation: thou saidst: Be converted ye children of men.\n"
	"Because a thousand years before thine eyes, are as yesterday that is past. And as a watch in the night,\n"
	"things that are counted nothing shall their years be.\n"
	"In the morning as an herb he shall pass, in the morning he shall flourish, and pass: in the evening he shall fall, be hardened, and withered.\n"
	"Because we have fainted in thy wrath, and in thy fury we are troubled.\n"
	"Thou hast put our iniquities in thy sight: our age in the light of thy countenance.\n"
	"Because all our days have failed, and in thy wrath we have failed. Our years shall be considered as a spider:\n"
	"the days of our years in them are seventy years. And if in strong ones eighty years: and the more of them, labour & sorrow. Because mildness is come upon us: and we shall be chastised.\n"
	"Who knoweth the power of thy wrath: and for fear\n"
	"to number thy wrath? So make thy right hand known: and men learned in heart, in wisdom.\n"
	"Turn, o Lord, how long? And be entreated for thy servants.\n"
	"We are replenished in the morning with thy mercy: and we have rejoiced, and art delighted all our days.\n"
	"We have rejoiced for the days wherein thou hast humbled us: the years, wherein we have seen evils.\n"
	"Look upon thy servants, and upon thy works: and direct their children.\n"
	"And let the brightness of our Lord God be upon us, and direct thou the works of our hands over us: and the work of our hands do thou direct.";

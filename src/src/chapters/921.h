const char* chap921 = "And the word of our Lord was made to me, saying:\n"
	"And thou son of man, thus saith our Lord God to the land of Israel: The end is come, come is the end upon the four quarters of the land.\n"
	"Now an end upon thee, and I will send my fury upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways: and I will lay against thee all thine abominations.\n"
	"And upon thee mine eye shall not spare, and I will not have mercy: but I will lay thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and you shall know that I am the Lord.\n"
	"Thus saith our Lord God: One affliction, lo affliction cometh.\n"
	"An end cometh, there cometh an end, it hath awaked against thee: behold it cometh.\n"
	"Destruction cometh upon thee, which dwellest in the land: the time cometh, the day of slaughter is near, & not of the glory of mountains.\n"
	"Now straight-way I pour out my wrath upon thee, & I will accomplish my fury in thee: & I will judge thee according to thy ways, & I will lay upon thee all thy wicked deeds.\n"
	"And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have mercy: but I will lay thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and you shall know that I am the Lord that strike.\n"
	"Behold the day, behold it cometh: destruction is gone forth, the rod hath flourished, pride hath budded.\n"
	"Iniquity is risen in the rod of impiety: not of them, and not of the people, nor of the sound of them: and there shall be no rest in them.\n"
	"The time cometh, the day is at hand: he that buyeth let him not rejoice: and he that selleth, let him not mourn: because wrath upon all the people thereof.\n"
	"Because he that selleth, shall not return to that which he hath sold, and as yet in the living the life of them. For the vision shall not go back to all the multitude thereof: and man in the iniquity of his life shall not be strengthened.\n"
	"Sound you with the trumpet, let all be prepared, and there is none to go to the battle: for my wrath shall be upon all the people thereof.\n"
	"The sword without, and the pestilence and famine within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword: & they that are in the city, shall be devoured with the pestilence and famine.\n"
	"And those of them that fly shall be saved: and they shall be in the mountains as doves of the valleys all trembling, every one in his iniquity.\n"
	"All hands shall be dissolved, & all knees shall run with waters.\n"
	"And they shall gird themselves with hair-cloths, and fear shall cover them, and in every face confusion, and upon all their heads baldness.\n"
	"Their silver shall be thrown forth, and their gold shall be into a dunghill. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the fury of our Lord. Their soul they shall not satisfy, and their bellies shall not be filled: because it is made a scandal of their iniquity.\n"
	"And the ornament of their Jewels they have turned into pride, and the images of their abominations, and idols they have made of it: for this cause have I given it them into uncleanness:\n"
	"and I will give it into the hands of aliens to spoil, and to the impious of the earth for a prey, and they shall contaminate it.\n"
	"And I will turn away my face from them, and they shall violate my secret: and spoilers shall enter into it, and shall contaminate it.\n"
	"Make a conclusion: because the land is full of the judgement of blood, and the city full of iniquity.\n"
	"And I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: and I will make the pride of the mighty to cease, and they shall possess their sanctuary.\n"
	"Distress coming upon them, they will seek peace, and there shall be none.\n"
	"Trouble shall come upon trouble, and report upon report, and they shall seek vision of the prophet, and the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.\n"
	"The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with sorrowfulness, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled. According to their way will I do to them, and according to their judgements I will judge them: and they shall know that I am the Lord.";

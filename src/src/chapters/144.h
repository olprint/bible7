	"And they stood before Moyses and Eleazar the Priest, and all the Princes of the people at the door of the tabernacle of covenant, and said:\n"
	"Our father died in the desert, neither was he in the sedition, that was raised against our Lord under Core, but he died in his own sin: he had no men children. Why is his name taken away out of his family, because he hath not a son? Give us possession among the kin of our father.\n"
	"And Moyses referred their cause to the judgment of our Lord.\n"
	"Who said to him:\n"
	"The daughters of Salphaad require a just thing: give them possession among their father's kin, and let them succeed him in the inheritance.\n"
	"And to the children of Israel thou shalt speak these things:\n"
	"When a man dieth without a son, his inheritance shall pass to his daughter.\n"
	"If he have no daughter, he shall have his brethren his successors.\n"
	"And if he have no brethren neither, you shall give the inheritance to his father's brethren.\n"
	"But if he have no such uncles by the father neither, the inheritance shall be given to them that are the next of kin: and this shall be to the children of Israel a holy ordinance by a perpetual law, as the Lord hath commanded Moyses.\n"
	"Our Lord also said to Moyses: Go up into this mountain Abarim, and view from thence the Land which I will give to the children of Israel:\n"
	"and when thou shall have seen it, thou also shall go to thy people, as thy brother Aaron is gone:\n"
	"because you did offend me in the desert Sin in the contradiction of the multitude, neither would you sanctify me before them upon the waters. These are the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert Sin.\n"
	"To whom Moyses answered:\n"
	"Our Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, provide a man that may be over this multitude:\n"
	"and may go out and enter in before them, and bring them out, or bring them in: lest the people of our Lord be as sheep without a pastor.\n"
	"And our Lord said to him: Take Josue the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and put thy hand upon him.\n"
	"Who shall stand before Eleazar the Priest and all the multitude:\n"
	"and thou shalt give him precepts in the sight of all, and part of thy glory, that all the synagogue of the children of Israel may hear him.\n"
	"For him, if any thing be to be done, Eleazar the Priest shall consult the Lord. At his word shall he go out and shall go in, and all the children of Israel with him, and the rest of the multitude.\n"
	"Moyses did as our Lord had commanded. And when he had taken Josue, he set him before Eleazar the Priest, and all the assembly of the people.\n"
	"And imposing his hands on his head, he repeated all things that our Lord had commanded.";

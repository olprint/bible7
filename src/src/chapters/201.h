	"dividing all things by lot, as our Lord had commanded in the hand of Moyses, to the nine tribes, and the half tribe.\n"
	"For to two tribes and a half Moyses had given possession beyond Jordan: besides the Levites, which received no land among their brethren:\n"
	"but into their place succeeded the children of Joseph divided into two tribes, of Manasses and Ephraim: neither did the Levites receive other portion in the Land, but cities to inhabit, and their suburbs to feed their beasts and cattle.\n"
	"As our Lord had commanded Moyses, so did the children of Israel, and they divided the Land.\n"
	"Therefore the children of Juda came to Josue in Galgal, and Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezeite spake to him: Thou knowest what our Lord spake to Moyses the man of God concerning me and thee in Cadesbarne.\n"
	"Forty years old was I when Moyses the servant of our Lord sent me from Cadesbarne, to view the Land, & I reported to him that which to me seemed true.\n"
	"But my brethren, that had gone up with me, discouraged the heart of the people: and I nevertheless followed our Lord God.\n"
	"And Moyses sware in that day, saying: The Land, which thy foot hath trodden, shall be thy possession, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast followed our Lord my God.\n"
	"Our Lord therefore hath granted me life, as he promised until this present day. It is forty and five years, since our Lord spake this word to Moyses, when Israel walked through the wilderness: this day am I eighty and five years old,\n"
	"so lusty, as I was at that time when I was sent to view: the strength of that time continueth in me until this day, as well to fight as to go.\n"
	"Give me therefore this mountain, which our Lord promised, thyself also hearing it, wherein are the Enacims, and great cities and fenced: if perhaps our Lord be with me, and I shall be able to destroy them, as he promised me.\n"
	"And Josue blessed him, and delivered to him Hebron in possession.\n"
	"And from thence-forth Hebron belonged to Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezeite, until this present day: because he followed our Lord the God of Israel.\n"
	"The name of Hebron before was called Cariath Arbe: Adam the greatest among the Enacims was laid there: and the Land ceased from battles.";

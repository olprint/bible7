const char* chap264 = "And it came to pass that in those days the Philisthiims gathered together their companies, that they might be prepared to battle against Israel: and Achis said to David: Knowing know thou now, that thou shalt go forth with me in the camp, thou, and thy men.\n"
	"And David said to Achis: Now thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achis said to David: And I will appoint thee keeper of my head all days.\n"
	"And Samuel was dead, and all Israel mourned for him, and buried him in Ramatha his city. And Saul took all the magicians & soothsayers out of the land.\n"
	"And the Philisthiims were gathered together, & came & camped in Sunam: and Saul also gathered together all Israel, & came into Gelboe.\n"
	"And Saul saw the camp of the Philisthiims, and feared, and his heart was afraid exceedingly.\n"
	"And he consulted our Lord, and he answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Priests nor by Prophets.\n"
	"And Saul said to his servants: Seek me a woman that hath a pythonical spirit, and I will go to her, and will ask by her. And his servants said to him: There is a woman that hath a pythonical spirit in Endor.\n"
	"He therefore changed his habit and was clothed with other garments, and he went himself, and two men with him, and they came to the woman in the night, and said to her: Divine unto me in the pythonical spirit, and raise me up whom I shall tell thee.\n"
	"And the woman said to him: Lo, thou knowest what great things Saul hath done, and how he hath rased the magicians and soothsayers out of the land: why therefore dost thou lie in wait for my life, that I may be slain?\n"
	"And Saul sware unto her in our Lord, saying: Our Lord liveth, there shall no evil happen unto thee for this thing.\n"
	"And the woman said to him: Whom shall I raise up to thee? Who said: Raise me up Samuel.\n"
	"And when the woman had seen Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and said to Saul: Why hast thou deceived me? For thou art Saul.\n"
	"And the king said to her: Fear not: what sawest thou? And the woman said to Saul: I saw gods coming out of the earth.\n"
	"And he said to her: What manner of form hath he? Who said: An old man is come up, and he is clothed with a mantle. And Saul understood that it was Samuel, and he bowed himself upon his face on the earth, and adored.\n"
	"And Samuel said to Saul: why hast thou disquieted me, that I should be raised up? And Saul said, I am in great distress: for the Philisthiims fight against me, and God is departed from me, and would not hear me, neither in the hand of Prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou shouldst shew me what I shall do.\n"
	"And Samuel said: Why askest thou, whereas our Lord is departed from thee, and is passed to thine adversary?\n"
	"For our Lord will do to thee as he spake in my hand, and he will cut thy Kingdom out of thy hand, & will give it to thy neighbour David:\n"
	"because thou hast not obeyed the voice of our Lord, neither didst thou the wrath of his fury in Amalec. Therefore that which thou sufferest hath our Lord done to thee this day.\n"
	"And our Lord will give Israel also with thee into the hands of the Philisthiims: and tomorrow thou and thy sons shall be with me: yea the camp also of Israel will our Lord deliver into the hands of the Philisthiims.\n"
	"And forthwith Saul fell stretched forth on the ground, for he feared much the words of Samuel, and there was no strength in him, because he had not eaten bread all that day.\n"
	"That woman therefore went unto Saul (for he was very much troubled) and said to him: Behold thy handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand: and I heard the words, which thou spakest to me.\n"
	"Now therefore hear thou also the voice of thy handmaid, and I will set before thee a morsel of bread, that eating thou mayest recover strength, and be able to go on thy journey.\n"
	"Who refused, and said: I will not eat. But his servants and the woman forced him, & at length hearing their voice, he arose from the ground, and sat upon the bed.\n"
	"And that woman had a pasture fed calf in the house, and she made haste, and killed him: and taking meal kneaded it, and baked azymes,\n"
	"and set before Saul, and before his servants, who when they had eaten rose up, and walked all that night.";
